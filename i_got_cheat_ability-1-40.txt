Part 2
  Meanwhile, at the same time that Evil was taking action, a secret experiment was being conducted in the Regal Kingdom, in the basement of the castle that Lexia and Luna had visited the other day.
A group of people in black robes surrounded a large magic circle were in discussion, each holding a book in their hands.
The people in robes were sorcerers of the Regal Kingdom.
“───How are things going?”
“! Your Majesty.”
Then, Orghis, the king of the Regal Kingdom, came down the stairs with a woman in an elegant dress.
The woman was about the same age as Yuuya, with long blond hair curled vertically. Her golden eyes carried a mixture of flamboyance and elegance. The woman, with her strong-willed eyes downcast, was standing behind Orghis.
Then one of the robed men opened his mouth.
“Everything is going well. Although I had never imagined that such magic existed…”
“That’s only natural───since it summons heroes and saints from other worlds.”
The words spoken from Orghis’s mouth would not have been missed if Yuuya had been present.
Orghis then took a book from a nearby sorcerer and gave it a quick look over.
“A long time ago… in the world of fairy tales where the recently rumored legendary dragons made an appearance, there was another existence in this folklore. This was the only person who reached the level of god──the Sage. The Sage was said to have created magic based on his experience of wandering into another world once.
“Yes. The Sage recognized the existence of another world and created magic to travel there again. And we’ve obtained some of his research materials.”
“Hmm. And the application of that research is this magic circle…”
Orghis said and gazed at the huge magic circle drawn in front of him.
For a time, many adventurers traveled the world searching for the lost research of the Sage scattered throughout the world, and the many countries fought each other for possession of the knowledge. As time went on, the countries signed a treaty to stop wars to fight over Sage’s literature, and it was forbidden for adventurers to seek them out.
However, the pieces that had already been acquired were treated as the treasures of each country. The countries that possessed them were encouraged to study them.
However, the Sage’s magic was too powerful for ordinary people to control.
Moreover, the effects of some of them are unknown until they are activated, and some of them are dangerous.
“In the story, it was said that in that other world was developed by an unknown technology that we do not know about, and it was very prosperous.”
“Are we so cornered that we have to rely on this unknown technology?”
“…Yes.”
One of the sorcerers nodded gravely at Orghis’ words.
Orghis also lowered his eyes with a bitter look on his face, but his eyes had a look of determination.
“…But, if we don’t do this… we will be destroyed by the Evil. We have no choice but to do this.”
“…..”
“As Sword Saint-dono is here, there’s nothing to worry about, but in many places… the Holy, which were supposed to oppose the Evil, had disappeared. This means that it’s possible that they’ve been defeated by the Evil, or perhaps…”
Orghis frowned as he imagined the worst-case scenario.
From the Sword Saint that he had welcomed to the Kingdom, Orghis had heard about the return of the Evil as well as the disappearances of an increasing number of the Holy.
Of course, the Sword Saint knew that many of the Holy had fallen to the Evil, but it was not disclosed to Orghis because the Sword Saint was aware that it was the Holy’s role to fight against the Evil.
After letting out a big sigh, Orghis called out to the woman who was standing behind him.
“…Layla.”
The woman called Layla is Orghis’ daughter and the first princess of this Regal Kingdom. With her good looks, high intelligence, and strong personality, she is adored by the people. Just like Lexia in the Alceria Kingdom, she is very popular.
Layla responded to Orghis’ call elegantly.
“Yes, father.”
“We will probably be condemned by the whole world when we perform this summoning… We are trying to bring people from other worlds to help us solve our problems. It’s no different from a kidnapping. Of course, by bringing them in, we intend to entertain them with the whole country. If a hero is summoned, we will give him all kinds of beautiful women. And… you may have to be offered as well.”
“…I understand.”
Layla understood the importance of the magic that was performed here and the cruelty of it. If the summoning fails, there will be no future for the human race in this world, and if it succeeds, people from other worlds will be asked to fight for them.
Either way, there was no choice.
The reason why they still put their faith in this gamble was that no one in this world could fight against the Evil anymore, and they couldn’t just sit back and let themselves perish.
The only way for humanity to survive and escape from the hands of Evil was to rely on a new power, even if it meant sacrificing another. Even if they had to commit the great sin of kidnapping a hero from another world and having the whole world be their enemy, they had to do it in order for humanity to continue to live in a world overflowing with positive power.
And Layla had an even more important responsibility.
Originally, the Regal Kingdom was known as the world’s leading nation in magic, with its active research in magic. As such, it had succeeded in reproducing some of the Sage’s magic, albeit to a limited extent.
And the royal family, who are the leaders of this magic superpower, inherited a high amount of magic power from generation to generation, and Layla, who was said to have the highest amount of magic power, was necessary to activate this magic.
“…This magic can only be activated by you, the most powerful magician in this country. For such a heavy responsibility to be placed on you──.”
“Father. I’m fine. So please, don’t worry.”
Layla smiled gracefully while remaining dignified.
Not only Orghis, but the sorcerers who were working nearby as well, could not say anything. Layla’s determined smile was very powerful and beautiful.
In response to that smile, Orghis was taken aback for a while but eventually responded with a bitter smile.
“Sigh… Really… You are a strong girl. This makes me pity the man who will take you as his wife.”
“Of course. It’s only natural that the man who marries me should be a strong man. That’s why the man who is summoned… has to be as strong as a hero…”
“Then, there’s no way you’re going to find a marriage partner in this world… No, come to think of it…”
“Father?”
Suddenly, Orghis remembered something, and Layla tilted her head.
“No, during the meeting with the princess of the Alceria Kingdom the other day… I can hardly believe it, but… it seems that there is a person who is followed by the legendary dragon.”
“Wha!? I-is that true?”
“Looking at Princess Lexia’s reaction, I don’t think it’s a lie… but it’s hard to believe that the legendary dragon exists in the first place. However, the earthquake that shook the earth during that time was unusual. Some folklore says that it was originally sleeping in a valley said to be near the Alceria Kingdom. It is said that the dragon had awakened and was tamed by a man.”
“N-no way… So, what is the name of that man?”
“Yes. I believe he was called Yuuya…”
“…That name sounds quite unfamiliar.”
“Yes. I’ve never heard of that name around here either. It’s not a common name in the Alceria Kingdom either, so he must be someone from another country. However, it is said that this person is the fiancée of Princess Lexia. But I don’t know if this is true or not.”
“Sigh…”
“But if there were such a man, he would be a suitable husband for you, and more importantly, we could count on him in the fight against the Evil.”
Layla, who had been listening to Orghis, shook her head.
“Father. Certainly, if such a man existed, I would gladly give myself to him. But this is impossible.”
“What?”
“In the first place, the legendary dragon is said to have been defeated by the Sage in the Sage’s mythology, isn’t it? I doubt it even existed.”
“That’s… but based on Sage’s research materials, he created magic as such. Perhaps the legendary dragon also existed?”
“That’s exactly the reason. This means that the story of the Sage who defeated the rampaging legendary dragon in the fairy tale is also true, right?”
“…I guess that’s true too.”
“Sure, the earthquake and the roar were unusual, but I don’t think it was because of the legendary dragon. A legend is still just a legend. So I think it’s probably an Ancient Dragon.”
“I see. But even if it is an Ancient Dragon, just the thought of having one around is a threat.”
“That’s true… but according to what father said earlier, isn’t that man already engaged to Princess Lexia?”
“Umu. That’s what Princess Lexia said… but judging from the reaction of the girl who was escorting her, it’s doubtful that they are really engaged. Most importantly, when the princess of the Alceria Kingdom becomes engaged, there should be a big announcement.”
“That’s… I guess that’s true.”
“He’s a mysterious person. But at the national festival, he’s going to have a match with the Sword Saint. We should be able to evaluate him there.”
“I’m looking forward to it.”
“Yes. Let’s enjoy the national festival to our heart’s content.”
“Yes. After that, we’ll perform this magic───.”
In the Regal Kingdom, a great plan was being implemented based on a strong conviction.

Part 3
  The story is once again set on the Earth’s “Ousei Academy.”
“Phew… I really studied hard today!”
“Well, studying is what students are supposed to do anyway.”
The classes were over for the day, and Kaede stretched in an exaggerated manner. Looking at her friend, Rin laughed in amusement.
    “Uuh… yes, I know that… but for me, it’s always better to be moving around…”
“But the test is just around the corner. If you get a failing grade, you won’t be able to participate in club activities, will you?”
“Noo! I don’t want to hear about the test!”
Rin laughed again at Kaede, who was covering her ears and shaking her head.
“Geez… I’ll have to look after you more.”
“T-thank you very much for your help…”
Kaede, who had always relied on Rin to help her study when a test was approaching, bowed her head honestly.
“Yes, yes… By the way, is it okay if you don’t go to your club activity?”
“Ah, yes! I’ve got the day off. So I can play as much as I want!”
“Isn’t this when you should go home and study?”
“R-Rin-chan, you’re so mean!”
Kaede shivered at Rin’s teasing words.
Then Rin spotted Yukine, who was about to leave the classroom.
“Oh, are you going home too, Yukine?”
“Oh, Yukine-chan, if you’re going too, let’s go home together!”
Yukine was surprised for a moment but then shook her head.
“…I have a club activity today.”
“Eh?”
“Oh, you’re in a club now, Yukine?”
The two of them widened their eyes as they realized that Yukine was participating in a club activity for the first time.
“Yukine-chan, weren’t you in the going home club before?”
“…Yes. But I recently found a club activity that looked interesting, so I joined it.”
“Really? What club is it?”
“Occult Research Club.”
“”Occult Research Club?””
Both Kaede and Rin were surprised by the unexpected club.
“I-I really thought it would be the light music club or something…”
“No, Kaede. That sounded like she’s a member of a band or something, but isn’t that a bit prejudiced?”
“I-I wonder?”
“…Well, I didn’t know there was an occult research club.”
Yukine tilted her head curiously at the two’s reaction.
“What? …Is it really that strange? The occult is interesting, you know?”
“R-really?”
“What is it about it, by the way?”
“…It’s a place where you can study phenomena that don’t exist in real life?”
“I-I see.”
Then Yukine suddenly thought of something and approached the two girls.
“…Since you’re free, would you like to come to visit?”
“Eh?”
“…Actually, we don’t have many members, and even though I joined the club, it’s about to be closed down. So we need new members.”
“N-no… I’m already a member of the track and field club…”
“Hmm… I think it’s interesting.”
“Eh, Rin-chan?”
Kaede rolled her eyes at Rin’s reaction.
“Well, I’ll give it a try!”
“…That reasoning is acceptable. Why don’t you just visit once and see for yourself? I got some interesting literature just today.”
“Really? I’m curious.”
“Ugh…”
“Hmm? Are you scared, Kaede…?”
“O-of course I am! The occult is about ghosts and devils, right?”
“…Yes.”
“See! How can you not be scared?”
Rin, feeling a bit mischievous at Kaede’s frightened appearance, told her with a smile.
“Well, that’s okay! Just listen to me today!”
“Eh, Rin-chan?”
“…Hmm. Then I will guide you,” said Yukine.
“Wait, wait, wait! I didn’t say I was coming──.”
“Hmm? For the test, I will be accompanying Kaede in her studies, so you can accompany me to the club, can’t you? You see, the test is coming up soon, right?”
“Ugh!”
Kaede groaned in pain when she was struck there.
“Now, let’s go!”
“…Yeah. This way.”
“Uuh! Rin-chan is really a demon!”
Kaede was half crying, but she followed behind Rin and Yukine.
  ＊＊＊
  Kaede and the others arrived at one of the empty classrooms in a place they don’t usually frequent.
“…This is the Occult Research Club’s clubroom.”
“Ugh… the atmosphere feels a bit gloomy…”
“You’re just worrying too much about that, you know?”
“I wonder…”
Despite the hesitation between the two, Yukine opened the door to the classroom.
“…Please come in.”
When they entered, there was a space with a different atmosphere, with straw dolls, insect specimens, and a large pot filled with a strange colored liquid. There were also books on the desk, some written in Japanese but also others written in various other languages.
Rin looked around the room with admiration, as the atmosphere of the club room was more organized than she had expected.
“Hee… it’s better than I expected.”
“Ri-Ri-Ri-Rin-chan!?”
“Kaede, are you afraid…?”
Because of fear, Kaede grabbed the hem of Rin’s clothes and shivered, but Rin couldn’t help but laugh. 
“By the way, what are you going to do today?” Rin asked Yukine.
“…This.”
In response to Rin’s question, Yukine took out a book from her bag and showed it to Rin.
“What’s that?”
“…I found it in my favorite secondhand bookstore. It’s a book about devil summoning.”
“De-de-devil summoning?”
“Hee, that sounds very occult.”
Rin laughed brightly at Kaede, who was about to faint. Yukine opened the book and explained while looking through it.
“…I bought this, did some research at home, and bought some materials today, so I’m going actually to draw a magic circle.”
“Y-you’re going to draw it?”
“Hmm? Well, it seemed that there were no senpai or other members of the club around. Is it okay to do that without permission?”
“…It’s fine. There are only a few of us, to begin with, but each of us can research any field that interests us. My interest is in devils and stuff like that.”
“I see.”
Yukine moved her desk to the edge of the classroom and laid a large piece of paper on the empty floor. She then drew a magic circle on the paper with a red magic marker, referring to the book on devil summoning she had picked up from the secondhand bookstore.
“I thought you were going to use some kind of blood to draw the magic circle, but it’s just with the magic marker?” said Rin.
“B-b-b-b-blood!?”
“…I think it’s… not a problem.”
“That’s very appropriate…”
“…Because it doesn’t really have to be followed exactly.”
“The world is tough, after all.”
In Yukine’s words, Rin shrugged her shoulders. Kaede was so shocked at the idea of using blood to draw magic circles that she stopped thinking.
In the meantime, Yukine finally finished drawing the magic circle.
“…It’s done.”
“Let me see… well, I have no idea what’s drawn here, though.”
“I-i-i-it is really okay, isn’t it?”
“It’s okay. You just need to calm down…”
“…Anyway, once we have this magic circle, all we have to do is read the spell on it.”
“That’s pretty simple, huh?”
“…Devils need to be summoned by humans to come to this world. So the simpler the process, the easier it is for them to be summoned by humans.”
“Hee? Is that so?”
“…I think it is.”
“You’re just assuming that…”
Rin was involuntarily taken aback by Yukine’s confident assertion. However, Yukine didn’t seem to be particularly bothered by this, and stood in front of the magic circle and began to read the spell in the book.
“───”
Even Kaede, who had been scared before, looked at Yukine as she read the spell in a serious expression.
And then───.
“────!”
And then she opened her eyes and read the spell out loud.
“…..”
“…..”
No change occurred in the magic circle. Yukine closed the book quietly and nodded her head once.
“…Well, I guess I can’t summon it, can I?”
“Eeeeehhhhhh!”
“…You’re so honest, aren’t you?”
Kaede and Rin were amazed and dumbfounded by the fact that Yukine was so straightforward.
“…This kind of thing is good because it’s unknown. It’s not so romantic when you can figure it out.”
“T-then, what’s the point of researching it…?”
“…Anyway, I failed this time. But it was fun, and I enjoyed the atmosphere, so it’s okay. I didn’t bring any other books to try, so that’s it for today’s experiment.”
“Huh. It ended so quickly. Is today’s club activity over then?”
“…Yeah.”
“Well, since we’re here, why don’t the three of us hang out and then go home?”
“…Okay.”
Rin decided to make plans for the rest of the day, and the three of them decided to go out together, and Kaede was finally able to relax.
But───.
“Yu-Yukine-chan, Rin-chan…”
“Hmm?”
“What’s up?”
“T-that’s…!”
Kaede, who seemed to have noticed something, pointed in that direction shakily. Rin and Yukine also looked in the direction of the finger pointing.
“”Eh?””
To their surprise, the magic circle drawn with a red magic marker had begun to emit a mysterious light.
“W-what’s going on here?”
“…Amazing. This book is real…”
“That’s not the point!”
“I-it’s bad, Rin-chan, Yukine-chan! The light is getting more intense!”
Kaede started to panic more than before, but even Rin did not expect this situation and started to panic.
“Yu-Yukine! What kind of devil did you say you were summoning?”
“…I don’t know. But I drew a magic circle that can summon the most powerful devil in the book.”
“I knew it…”
Rin’s cheeks twitched at Yukine’s response.
If what Yukine says is true, then the devil that is about to be summoned is a powerful being. Even the mere idea of a devil being summoned is a serious matter, but when it’s a powerful devil, it’s a disaster.
However, ignoring the three of them, the light of the magic circle increased, and finally, the entire classroom was filled with light.
“Ugh!”
“It’s so bright…!”
“…I wonder what will appear.”
“You have to be more serious, Yukine!”
When the light finally subsided, Kaede and the others fearfully opened their eyes.
“…T-that…?”
“That is…”
“…It’s strange. There’s nothing there!”
There was nothing, not even a devil-like figure, in the magic circle where the light had settled.
“Yukine. Can we see the devil properly?”
“…We should be.”
“Ah, Yukine-chan?”
Yukine nodded at Rin’s words and approached the magic circle in question without hesitation. And she tried to touch the magic circle and lifted the paper on which the magic circle was drawn, but no changes occurred.
“…Yes. It glowed that much, but it seems to have failed. Too bad.”
“W-what do you mean by too bad…?”
“Well, I was surprised when the light came out of nowhere, but I guess I can understand the disappointment.”
It’s a shame that Yukine’s experiment failed, considering that they might be able to meet an unknown being, even if the word “devil” conjured up fear. For a few more moments, Yukine reread the book and checked the magic circle she had drawn, but she could not confirm the devil’s existence, so she finished cleaning up and left the club room this time.
“I was afraid of what would happen, but this was a unique experience.”
“I was really scared, though…”
“I’m sorry! I’ll buy you an ice cream or something now.”
“Ugh… Then I will forgive you.”
“Sorry… you had to wait.”
“No, I didn’t mind waiting. Let’s go.”
The three of them had already forgotten what had just happened and were discussing their plans to have fun. At that moment, Yukine felt a vague sense of discomfort that she couldn’t put into words and looked around.
“…..?”
“What’s wrong?”
“…No, it’s nothing.”
No one noticed that there was something wrong with──Yukine’s shadow and that her eyes were red. Thus, various incidents were occurring in three different places at the same time.

“Umu. That’s what Princess Lexia said… but judging from the reaction of the girl who was escorting her, it’s doubtful that they are really engaged. Most importantly, when the princess of the Alceria Kingdom becomes engaged, there should be a big announcement.”
“That’s… I guess that’s true.”
“He’s a mysterious person. But at the national festival, he’s going to have a match with the Sword Saint. We should be able to evaluate him there.”
“I’m looking forward to it.”
“Yes. Let’s enjoy the national festival to our heart’s content.”
“Yes. After that, we’ll perform this magic───.”
In the Regal Kingdom, a great plan was being implemented based on a strong conviction.

Part 3
  The story is once again set on the Earth’s “Ousei Academy.”
“Phew… I really studied hard today!”
“Well, studying is what students are supposed to do anyway.”
The classes were over for the day, and Kaede stretched in an exaggerated manner. Looking at her friend, Rin laughed in amusement.
    “Uuh… yes, I know that… but for me, it’s always better to be moving around…”
“But the test is just around the corner. If you get a failing grade, you won’t be able to participate in club activities, will you?”
“Noo! I don’t want to hear about the test!”
Rin laughed again at Kaede, who was covering her ears and shaking her head.
“Geez… I’ll have to look after you more.”
“T-thank you very much for your help…”
Kaede, who had always relied on Rin to help her study when a test was approaching, bowed her head honestly.
“Yes, yes… By the way, is it okay if you don’t go to your club activity?”
“Ah, yes! I’ve got the day off. So I can play as much as I want!”
“Isn’t this when you should go home and study?”
“R-Rin-chan, you’re so mean!”
Kaede shivered at Rin’s teasing words.
Then Rin spotted Yukine, who was about to leave the classroom.
“Oh, are you going home too, Yukine?”
“Oh, Yukine-chan, if you’re going too, let’s go home together!”
Yukine was surprised for a moment but then shook her head.
“…I have a club activity today.”
“Eh?”
“Oh, you’re in a club now, Yukine?”
The two of them widened their eyes as they realized that Yukine was participating in a club activity for the first time.
“Yukine-chan, weren’t you in the going home club before?”
“…Yes. But I recently found a club activity that looked interesting, so I joined it.”
“Really? What club is it?”
“Occult Research Club.”
“”Occult Research Club?””
Both Kaede and Rin were surprised by the unexpected club.
“I-I really thought it would be the light music club or something…”
“No, Kaede. That sounded like she’s a member of a band or something, but isn’t that a bit prejudiced?”
“I-I wonder?”
“…Well, I didn’t know there was an occult research club.”
Yukine tilted her head curiously at the two’s reaction.
“What? …Is it really that strange? The occult is interesting, you know?”
“R-really?”
“What is it about it, by the way?”
“…It’s a place where you can study phenomena that don’t exist in real life?”
“I-I see.”
Then Yukine suddenly thought of something and approached the two girls.
“…Since you’re free, would you like to come to visit?”
“Eh?”
“…Actually, we don’t have many members, and even though I joined the club, it’s about to be closed down. So we need new members.”
“N-no… I’m already a member of the track and field club…”
“Hmm… I think it’s interesting.”
“Eh, Rin-chan?”
Kaede rolled her eyes at Rin’s reaction.
“Well, I’ll give it a try!”
“…That reasoning is acceptable. Why don’t you just visit once and see for yourself? I got some interesting literature just today.”
“Really? I’m curious.”
“Ugh…”
“Hmm? Are you scared, Kaede…?”
“O-of course I am! The occult is about ghosts and devils, right?”
“…Yes.”
“See! How can you not be scared?”
Rin, feeling a bit mischievous at Kaede’s frightened appearance, told her with a smile.
“Well, that’s okay! Just listen to me today!”
“Eh, Rin-chan?”
“…Hmm. Then I will guide you,” said Yukine.
“Wait, wait, wait! I didn’t say I was coming──.”
“Hmm? For the test, I will be accompanying Kaede in her studies, so you can accompany me to the club, can’t you? You see, the test is coming up soon, right?”
“Ugh!”
Kaede groaned in pain when she was struck there.
“Now, let’s go!”
“…Yeah. This way.”
“Uuh! Rin-chan is really a demon!”
Kaede was half crying, but she followed behind Rin and Yukine.
  ＊＊＊
  Kaede and the others arrived at one of the empty classrooms in a place they don’t usually frequent.
“…This is the Occult Research Club’s clubroom.”
“Ugh… the atmosphere feels a bit gloomy…”
“You’re just worrying too much about that, you know?”
“I wonder…”
Despite the hesitation between the two, Yukine opened the door to the classroom.
“…Please come in.”
When they entered, there was a space with a different atmosphere, with straw dolls, insect specimens, and a large pot filled with a strange colored liquid. There were also books on the desk, some written in Japanese but also others written in various other languages.
Rin looked around the room with admiration, as the atmosphere of the club room was more organized than she had expected.
“Hee… it’s better than I expected.”
“Ri-Ri-Ri-Rin-chan!?”
“Kaede, are you afraid…?”
Because of fear, Kaede grabbed the hem of Rin’s clothes and shivered, but Rin couldn’t help but laugh. 
“By the way, what are you going to do today?” Rin asked Yukine.
“…This.”
In response to Rin’s question, Yukine took out a book from her bag and showed it to Rin.
“What’s that?”
“…I found it in my favorite secondhand bookstore. It’s a book about devil summoning.”
“De-de-devil summoning?”
“Hee, that sounds very occult.”
Rin laughed brightly at Kaede, who was about to faint. Yukine opened the book and explained while looking through it.
“…I bought this, did some research at home, and bought some materials today, so I’m going actually to draw a magic circle.”
“Y-you’re going to draw it?”
“Hmm? Well, it seemed that there were no senpai or other members of the club around. Is it okay to do that without permission?”
“…It’s fine. There are only a few of us, to begin with, but each of us can research any field that interests us. My interest is in devils and stuff like that.”
“I see.”
Yukine moved her desk to the edge of the classroom and laid a large piece of paper on the empty floor. She then drew a magic circle on the paper with a red magic marker, referring to the book on devil summoning she had picked up from the secondhand bookstore.
“I thought you were going to use some kind of blood to draw the magic circle, but it’s just with the magic marker?” said Rin.
“B-b-b-b-blood!?”
“…I think it’s… not a problem.”
“That’s very appropriate…”
“…Because it doesn’t really have to be followed exactly.”
“The world is tough, after all.”
In Yukine’s words, Rin shrugged her shoulders. Kaede was so shocked at the idea of using blood to draw magic circles that she stopped thinking.
In the meantime, Yukine finally finished drawing the magic circle.
“…It’s done.”
“Let me see… well, I have no idea what’s drawn here, though.”
“I-i-i-it is really okay, isn’t it?”
“It’s okay. You just need to calm down…”
“…Anyway, once we have this magic circle, all we have to do is read the spell on it.”
“That’s pretty simple, huh?”
“…Devils need to be summoned by humans to come to this world. So the simpler the process, the easier it is for them to be summoned by humans.”
“Hee? Is that so?”
“…I think it is.”
“You’re just assuming that…”
Rin was involuntarily taken aback by Yukine’s confident assertion. However, Yukine didn’t seem to be particularly bothered by this, and stood in front of the magic circle and began to read the spell in the book.
“───”
Even Kaede, who had been scared before, looked at Yukine as she read the spell in a serious expression.
And then───.
“────!”
And then she opened her eyes and read the spell out loud.
“…..”
“…..”
No change occurred in the magic circle. Yukine closed the book quietly and nodded her head once.
“…Well, I guess I can’t summon it, can I?”
“Eeeeehhhhhh!”
“…You’re so honest, aren’t you?”
Kaede and Rin were amazed and dumbfounded by the fact that Yukine was so straightforward.
“…This kind of thing is good because it’s unknown. It’s not so romantic when you can figure it out.”
“T-then, what’s the point of researching it…?”
“…Anyway, I failed this time. But it was fun, and I enjoyed the atmosphere, so it’s okay. I didn’t bring any other books to try, so that’s it for today’s experiment.”
“Huh. It ended so quickly. Is today’s club activity over then?”
“…Yeah.”
“Well, since we’re here, why don’t the three of us hang out and then go home?”
“…Okay.”
Rin decided to make plans for the rest of the day, and the three of them decided to go out together, and Kaede was finally able to relax.
But───.
“Yu-Yukine-chan, Rin-chan…”
“Hmm?”
“What’s up?”
“T-that’s…!”
Kaede, who seemed to have noticed something, pointed in that direction shakily. Rin and Yukine also looked in the direction of the finger pointing.
“”Eh?””
To their surprise, the magic circle drawn with a red magic marker had begun to emit a mysterious light.
“W-what’s going on here?”
“…Amazing. This book is real…”
“That’s not the point!”
“I-it’s bad, Rin-chan, Yukine-chan! The light is getting more intense!”
Kaede started to panic more than before, but even Rin did not expect this situation and started to panic.
“Yu-Yukine! What kind of devil did you say you were summoning?”
“…I don’t know. But I drew a magic circle that can summon the most powerful devil in the book.”
“I knew it…”
Rin’s cheeks twitched at Yukine’s response.
If what Yukine says is true, then the devil that is about to be summoned is a powerful being. Even the mere idea of a devil being summoned is a serious matter, but when it’s a powerful devil, it’s a disaster.
However, ignoring the three of them, the light of the magic circle increased, and finally, the entire classroom was filled with light.
“Ugh!”
“It’s so bright…!”
“…I wonder what will appear.”
“You have to be more serious, Yukine!”
When the light finally subsided, Kaede and the others fearfully opened their eyes.
“…T-that…?”
“That is…”
“…It’s strange. There’s nothing there!”
There was nothing, not even a devil-like figure, in the magic circle where the light had settled.
“Yukine. Can we see the devil properly?”
“…We should be.”
“Ah, Yukine-chan?”
Yukine nodded at Rin’s words and approached the magic circle in question without hesitation. And she tried to touch the magic circle and lifted the paper on which the magic circle was drawn, but no changes occurred.
“…Yes. It glowed that much, but it seems to have failed. Too bad.”
“W-what do you mean by too bad…?”
“Well, I was surprised when the light came out of nowhere, but I guess I can understand the disappointment.”
It’s a shame that Yukine’s experiment failed, considering that they might be able to meet an unknown being, even if the word “devil” conjured up fear. For a few more moments, Yukine reread the book and checked the magic circle she had drawn, but she could not confirm the devil’s existence, so she finished cleaning up and left the club room this time.
“I was afraid of what would happen, but this was a unique experience.”
“I was really scared, though…”
“I’m sorry! I’ll buy you an ice cream or something now.”
“Ugh… Then I will forgive you.”
“Sorry… you had to wait.”
“No, I didn’t mind waiting. Let’s go.”
The three of them had already forgotten what had just happened and were discussing their plans to have fun. At that moment, Yukine felt a vague sense of discomfort that she couldn’t put into words and looked around.
“…..?”
“What’s wrong?”
“…No, it’s nothing.”
No one noticed that there was something wrong with──Yukine’s shadow and that her eyes were red. Thus, various incidents were occurring in three different places at the same time.

Chapter 1 – The Sword Saint
Part 1
  ───The [Orz Forest] was located near the Regal Kingdom. It’s a place overflowing with rich nature, and the forest brought a lot of resources and benefits to the Regal Kingdom.
At the same time, this forest was known throughout the world as one of the dangerous zones.
The danger level was lower than that of the Great Devil’s Nest because the Great Devil’s Nest, where Yuuya lives, had been designated as a super-dangerous zone that was even more dangerous than this forest.
However, because this [Orz Forest] had valuable resources more accessible than the Great Devil’s Nest, many adventurers and others come and go, and the monsters were naturally thinned out, so it was safe for people to live in a city near the forest.
Furthermore, there was one reason why the Regal Kingdom was a safer place now than ever before.
That is───.
“Grrrr…”
“Guruahh!”
“Guruaaaah!”
“…..”
A woman was standing there, surrounded by several monsters. She had a wolf cut of peach-colored hair and slit pink eyes. She was wearing a silver breastplate, a jet-black cloak, and a single sword.
This place was too dangerous for a person to be visiting alone, and even now, the woman was surrounded by a pack of black tigers, a B class monster with black body hair and white stripes.
If it’s a single tiger, an adventurer of B class or higher can defeat it, but the number of black tigers surrounding the woman now numbered over a dozen.
Normally, a party of A-level adventurers or S-level adventurers would be needed to defeat them. However, the black tigers, despite being such dangerous beasts, showed an unusual degree of caution towards the woman in front of them and were reluctant to attack.
“Grrrr… Gaaaaaaaaah!”
Then one of the black tigers became impatient and finally attacked the woman.
Clank───.
“Gah───.”
But in the next moment… with a clear metallic sound, the head of the black tiger slipped off its body and fell down without knowing the reason. The other black tigers became more cautious because of their companions’ death. Still, their anger at the loss of a companion did not subside, and they finally attacked the woman together.
“Gaaaaaaaahhhhh!”
“Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”
In spite of the fact that she was being attacked by the deafening roars that would make an ordinary person faint, the woman herself continued to stand there, looking as if nothing had happened.
And then───.
Clank───.
“Gugahh───.”
“Gaah───.”
The black tigers attacked at once, their heads and bodies cut apart in midair, and they fell down.
“…..”
The pack of black tigers turned into particles of light and left a drop item on the spot. The woman who was attacked quietly gazed at it, and before long, she sheathed the sword in her hand.
“Phew… This isn’t gonna be much of a training session then.”
The woman who said these unbelievable words was the “Sword Saint”───Iris Knowblade, who was currently residing in the Regal Kingdom.
“…I mean, it’s no good because of the things I say…”
Iris let out a big sigh, disgusted with her own words, actions, and thoughts.
That’s───.
“Sigh…I’m the only one of my classmates who hasn’t married yet… and I can’t stop training with my sword… so what am I supposed to do…?”
The strongest and most famous sword saint was worried about her nearing the end of her marriageable age.
Iris has been fascinated with swords ever since she can remember and honed her skills to become a knight eventually. However, the House of Knowblade, where Iris was born, was a great noble family with the title of duke, and Iris’s father did not allow Iris to become a knight.
Therefore, although Iris originally wanted to attend a knight’s school, her father forced her to attend a girls’ school for the daughters of noble families. Naturally, Iris rebelled against her father’s decision. But with the pressure from the Knowblade family, and with the persuasion of those around her, she reluctantly entered the girls’ school.
“I was sent to a girls’ school, but it didn’t mean much to me.”
“Gaaaaaah!”
Suddenly, remembering her old self, Iris sliced through the new monsters that were attacking her. However, Iris does not seem to have pulled out her sword, and only a clear metallic sound echoes.
───Her parents intended for her to enter a girls’ school to learn how to behave like a lady and to prepare her to marry into another noble house or royalty eventually.
But because she was more interested in swords than romance, and because she hadn’t mastered any of the behaviors expected of a noblewoman, her father was unable to find a suitable engagement for his daughter, or even arrange an engagement, with any noble family.
There were even some offers from noblemen who could be a great connection for the Knowblade family, but the Knowblade family would lose their dignity and trust if they sent the inexperienced Iris in marriage, so they tearfully turned down the talks of engagement.
“───Guruahh!”
“G-gaaaaah!”
Iris cut down the monsters one after the other, showing a sense of composure that made it hard to believe that she was being attacked by monsters. She was so bizarre that even the monsters even tried to run away, but they could not escape from Iris’s blade.
“I wanted to give up the path of the sword, but there was no proposal for an arranged marriage for me. It’s strange when I think about it… I wonder what the reason for that was…?”
Iris, who was unaware of her parents’ intentions, grew up doing whatever she wanted, even though she was not able to quit the girls’ school halfway through.
However, Iris never abandoned her sword, regardless of the school she attended.
Furthermore, the school she entered was not a normal school, but the prestigious Artemia Girls’ Academy, and the headmistress was a legendary witch who had once worked as an S-class adventurer despite being a noblewoman.
That’s why, even though it’s a girl’s academy, there were classes to learn how to defend oneself, and Iris didn’t neglect to practice voluntarily. As a result, Iris acquired abilities that far exceeded those of her classmates and obtained a power that overwhelmed even the teachers.
Then, the headmaster of the school, who was interested in Iris’ abilities, introduced a certain person to Iris. That person was the former “Sword Saint,” who would become Iris’s master.
“Gu-guaaaa!”
“Guooooo!”
“When I think about it now, it’s because of that encounter that I have become the person I am today.”
Recalling her predecessor, the former “Sword Saint,” Iris cut down the fleeing monsters.
───Since her predecessor was also a woman, she took an interest in Iris, who also wanted to pursue the path of the sword. Iris had a talent for swordsmanship, so she officially became an apprentice, and from there, she became even more devoted to swordsmanship.
However, she could not neglect her studies, so she reluctantly continued to attend the girls’ school.
Although she devoted herself entirely to the sword, she was blessed with many friends.
The other students were all girls who were ladylike and seemed to have a hard time with the self-defense classes, but they were surprisingly compatible with Iris. The girls learned self-defense from Iris, and Iris learned how to act like a lady from them.
Gradually, Iris’s mindset began to change. At first, Iris had no interest in anything but swords, but by the time she was about to graduate, she was as interested as any woman in topics such as romance and marriage.
It was common for the fairy-tale existence of a Holy to be feared more than necessary by those around her, but perhaps because she was blessed with the environment of the girl’s academy, Iris was surrounded by many friends, which was unusual for a “Holy.”
And when Iris finally graduated from the academy, her father could do nothing about it, as she had already surpassed her predecessor and taken over the title of “Sword Saint.”
No matter how much influence the Knowblade family had as a duke house, a “Holy” who dealt with the “Evil” enemy of the world was treated with more importance in some countries, so Iris’s father no longer had the power or strength to control Iris’s life.
That’s why Iris’s father had given up on her. He gave up on the idea of marrying Iris off to another family and decided not to interfere with her. This was exactly what Iris had wanted.
However, after graduation, her friends got married one after another, and she became the only single person left in her class. This was when she started to think about marriage for the first time.
However, since she had never been in love before marriage, she had to learn about love first.
“It’s not right… It wasn’t supposed to be like this…!”
Iris had reached the turn of her twenties. In this world, it was normal for people to be married by their early twenties at the latest. Iris had not married, or had even been in a relationship with a man.
“I was approached so many times before, but now no one is talking to me… Why… why has it become like this…?”
Iris stared at the ground in a dark mood.
As Iris said, she was often approached by men when she was a girls’ school student on the street. Even though she was in her late twenties now, there was no way that Iris, with her overwhelming good looks, would not be approached.
But Iris had set conditions for the man she wanted to go out with: he had to be stronger than her, he had to be financially secure, and he had to be good-looking. …She had set these conditions.
That’s why she turned down all the men, who picked her up or approached her directly about an engagement, as they didn’t meet all the requirements. And as a result──no one talked to her anymore as she was unapproachable.
“I-I know I’ve been very strict with my requirements. So now I’ve changed my mind…!”
Iris said this in an impatient tone, making excuses to no one in particular.
Then, behind such a defenseless Iris, a single monster was quietly creeping up on her.
It was a black snake called an “Assassin’s Snake,” a rank A monster with a massive body of up to five meters in length, but its skills had completely shut out the sound and presence as it crept closer.
It was difficult to detect because it used skills to hide even its huge body, and many adventurers had fallen victim to its surprise attacks.
The Assassin Snake quietly and calmly aimed at Iris───.
“Shh!”
“───I don’t need a man to be rich or cool; I just want someone stronger than me!”
Clank───.
    When the clear metallic sound was heard again, the assassin snake’s neck and torso were split apart, and it died. In Iris’s hand, she was holding onto a sword again.
“I wonder if there is anyone stronger than me…”
Although Iris had completely misjudged which of her conditions should have been loosened, for Iris, wanting someone stronger than herself was unavoidable.
She grew up without knowing about romance, and as she developed delusions of being in love, she longed for a prince who could protect her and save her. Iris could not abandon this fantasy she had once yearned for.
The somewhat disappointing “Sword Saint” Iris was overwhelmingly strong, but she was struggling against a powerful enemy called marriage.

ED: Blast
Chapter 1 Part 2
  After the fight with the Fist Saint, Master Usagi had completely recovered from his wounds, partly thanks to Akatsuki’s [Sanctuary] skill. However, the physical strength he had lost could not be easily regained, so he took a break from training with me and went somewhere for rest.
Even so, I couldn’t skip my regular training, so I continued my own training with the help of Yuti and Night.
If I had to, I could have asked Ouma-san to help me. Still, since there was too much of a difference in skills between him and I, it wouldn’t have been helpful in my training. More importantly, Ouma-san wasn’t very interested in helping me to begin with.
I’m not saying he should be my sparring partner, but it would have been nice if he could at least give me some advice on where I might be lacking… but forcing him to help is not a good idea either.
So, after the fight with the Fist Saint, I gradually regained my composure and was living a balanced life with school. After a long time, Master Usagi visited me.
(It’s been a while.)
“Ah, Master Usagi! It’s been a while. How have you been?”
(No problem. My wounds were already healed in the first place. All I needed was some rest to regain my strength.)
“If that’s the case, it’s good then, but…”
As I was worried about whether his strength would return so easily, Yuti came out into the garden of the other world’s house.
“Don’t worry. A Holy is not that weak. Above all, they have a gift from the planet.”
“G-gift from the planet?”
[T/n: I’m not sure if I should translate it as a planet or a star, the kanji is Hoshi (星)]
I’ve been involved with the Holy and the Evil for some time now, but having reached this point, I could tell from what Yuti had said that there were still some abilities that I wasn’t aware of. But for me, I’d rather live in peace without getting involved.
I remembered that when I first met Master Usagi, he explained to me that the title of “Holy” was granted by the planet.
Master Usagi nodded in response to Yuti’s words.
(Yeah. I had briefly mentioned it when I met you. We “Holy” are chosen by the planet and given the title. And being chosen as a Holy comes with an obligation to raise a successor. By letting that successor inherit the title, the Holy will continue… Well, some of them did not find a successor and disappeared in the past. Just like Gilbert who you dealt with recently… he has no disciples.)
“S-so there won’t be a next Fist Saint?”
(No. The disappeared Fist Saint will be selected by the planet again, and the title will be given to that person. I don’t know if one will be selected right now, though.)
“I-I see…”
As I nodded at Master Usagi’s words, he continued.
(As you can guess from what I’ve said so far, there is a close relationship between us, the Holy, and the planet. For example, we receive support from the planet, or rather, special benefits… One of these benefits is that we recover our strength faster than other living beings. This is because the planet needs us, the Holy, to defeat the Evil. So, don’t worry about my strength – it’s back to normal.)
“I see…”
I was relieved to hear Master Usagi’s words, but then I suddenly realized something.
“…Huh? In that case, what kind of existence does the Fist Saint and Yuti who attacked us have? Although Yuti has not yet become the Bow Saint, she still has the power of Evil. And as for the Fist Saint, he has both the power of Holy and Evil, right? Isn’t this a bad situation for the planet?”
Master Usagi gave a bitter expression to my pure question.
(…Your point is correct. This situation is dangerous for the planet. The Holy, which were supposed to counter the Evil, are now turning on the planet and humanity.)
“If that’s the case, won’t the title of Holy be taken back by the planet?”
(That’s impossible. The planet can give the titles, but it can’t take it away. I told you before, didn’t I? We, the Holy, are like the cleaners of this planet. And examples like the Fist Saint are the so-called outbursts of that function. It’s uncontrollable.)
“Eeh…?”
What an inconvenient existence.
A Holy bearer is a powerful force when on your side but a nuisance as an enemy, and you can’t even strip them of their title.
“…Also, I was wondering about one more thing, when the Holy fight against the Evil, their stats are doubled, right? When you fought the Fist Saint, did your stats increase?”
At my question, Master Usagi let out a tired sigh.
(I wish that was the case…)
“Eh?”
(…In other words, my status remained halved.)
“Eeehhhh?”
I was surprised to hear Master Usagi’s unexpected remark.
Then, Yuti tilted her head in wonder.
“Question. Is that also the same as when you fought me?”
(Yes, that’s right. We, the Holy, will only have our status unlocked when we fight against the Evil. In other words, if our opponent is a Holy, or if they have acquired just part of the Evil’s power, our status will not be unlocked. The only time it can be unlocked is when I’m fighting the real Evil.)
“…..”
I couldn’t say anything else. Although it is possible to gain power from the planet, it is still very difficult, isn’t it…?
No, without this kind of restriction, when a person like the Fist Saint comes out with their status unlocked, there is no way to reach their level.
The reason why Master Usagi was defeated by the Fist Saint was probably that Master Usagi’s status was halved, while the Fist Saint was able to borrow the power of Evil.
Master Usagi looked at me with serious eyes as I was thinking that it would be bad if there were more and more situations where a Holy being like the Fist Saint gained the Evil’s power.
(And also, Yuuya)
“Y-yes.”
(──So you’ve obtained the power of the real Evil.)
“Huh?”
I was surprised by the unexpected statement. Yuti was also astonished by Master Usagi’s words.
“Denial. That’s not right. The Evil power inside Yuuya was originally mine. In other words, it’s only a part of the power of Evil.”
(…I thought so too. However, the power that drifted from Yuuya at that time was so dense and powerful that it could not be described as just a borrowed part of the Evil. It can be said that the power of Evil had completely assimilated with him.)
“Umm…”
(In other words, it’s a power with the same quality as the Evil that I once faced. At the time with Yuti, it was like the power of Evil was mixed in. But in your case, your whole body was filled with the power of Evil.)
I had heard about what happened from Yuti and Master Usagi when the Fist Saint attacked.
It’s hard to believe, but it seems that I, with the power of Evil running rampant inside of me, defeated the Fist Saint. Even though they told me the situation, I don’t remember anything from that time…
And that rampant power was the power of Evil itself. And it seems that the power of Evil that I took from Yuti had become stronger. Even though this was explained to me, it didn’t make sense to me.
Then I suddenly heard the voice of the Evil inside me, which I hadn’t heard since the fight with the Fist Saint.
“Fuwahh… I slept well…”
“Ah!”
“?”
(What’s wrong?)
As I raised my voice, Yuti and Master Usagi looked at me curiously.
I told them that the Evil inside me had just woken up, and Master Usagi suggested that I ask it about my fight with the Fist Saint.
“Um, good morning.”
“Ah? Ohh. I thought you would be more exhausted! Hahaha. So, what’s up? Now that I look more closely, I can see that the Kicking Saint and even my previous host are here.”
“No, the other day, the Fist Saint attacked me, right? It seems that my power that manifested at that time was not the same as it was with Yuti; it was more like the power of Evil itself rather than your power. Do you know anything about that?”
“Ah, so that’s what this is about… It’s simple. The reason is that your heart was too white.”
“Huh?”
This is the first time I’ve ever heard of such a thing.
“W-what do you mean by ‘too white’…?”
“Didn’t I say it before? I tried to take over you, but your heart was too white for me to take over. But then you saw that bastard Kicking Saint there getting beaten up by the Fist Saint, and you got mad.”
“I got mad? That was unforgivable at the time, so…”
“The anger that you felt at that time was so black that it far surpassed even Yuti’s desire for revenge. That black heart even bottled me up and had certainly created the power of Evil in you. In other words, you are the cause. However, an ordinary person could never create the power of Evil with just anger alone. That’s where my existence comes in as the catalyst.”
“Eeh?”
“And it’s also great that you have this aptitude for Evil. It’s uncommon for a person to generate such emotions and be compatible with the Evil, you know? In most cases, you would end up having your heart swallowed by the Evil as it is.”
“S-seriously…?”
Apparently, the power from the Evil residing inside of me and my anger caused a chemical reaction that resulted in a complete manifestation of the Evil. Also, it seems that I was able to adapt to the Evil.
But why was I compatible with the Evil?
When I was thinking about it, I suddenly remembered the [Endurance] skill that I originally had. I wondered if this was an effect of this skill?
When Master Usagi heard my explanation, he furrowed his face.
(…Things have gotten complicated, haven’t they?)
“Then… what am I supposed to do?”
(You have no choice but to master that power. If not, you’ll become a target for us, the Holy, to defeat.)
“Eeh? That would be a problem!”
It’s not funny to be involved in this conflict, and then be defeated.
Master Usagi let out a big sigh at my panicked reaction.
(Sigh… The training from now on will be for you to master this power. One of the tasks is to interact with the Evil inside you… but it seems that you can handle that, apparently.)
“Well, yes, I guess so. Right?”
“Keh… you’ve been talking all the time to me on your own, haven’t you?”
The Evil power, which was called out by me, answered in an indifferent manner. Master Usagi and the others are watching the conversation between me and the Evil power. Well, I’m the only one who can hear the voice of the Evil power, though.
“Hmm… but Master Usagi is right, if I’m going to communicate with you, I need a name for you too, right?”
“Oh? A name?”
“Yes. Well, it’s not right to call you the Evil power every time, is it?”
As an entity, it is a piece of the Evil power inside me, but as long as we can communicate like this, I think it’s better to have a name.
It will make it easier to communicate…
“So, do you mind if I give you a name?”
“…Keh. It’s up to you.”
It continues to be nonchalant, but it doesn’t reject me, so maybe it doesn’t hate me that much.
Now, when it comes to giving a name… it will be that.
I had a strong image of it when I first saw it. I was troubled by various things, but I still couldn’t get the first image out of my head.
“Hmm… how about Kuro?”
“Huh? Kuro?”
“Yes. Because when I first met you, you were a black version of Yuti.”
When I said that, both Yuti and Master Usagi looked at me in surprise. H-huh?
“Surprise. It’s too simple.”
(…As expected, that’s outrageous.)
“T-that’s just it!”
…No, their reaction is normal. It’s too simple, and it’s just a color.
“Sorry, I guess it’s──.”
“That’s fine. Kuro, huh? It’s easy to understand.”
“Eeh? Are you sure?”
“…It’s your decision, not mine.”
No way, I didn’t think that the Evil power──Kuro, would accept it in such a straightforward manner.
Then, Kuro said with a dumbfounded look.
“It’s better than being given an ostentatious name. It makes me sick.”
“I-is that so?”
As I tilted my head in confusion, Yuti and Master Usagi opened their mouths.
“Suggestion. The name should be “Toto Schwarzer.” That’s settled.”
(Huh. You don’t know what you’re talking about, do you, little girl? Of course, I prefer Jiromaru.”
“…Kuro is a perfect choice,” said Kuro immediately.
“R-really?”
It seems that Kuro did not like the names that Yuti and Master Usagi proposed. I think they’re both more elaborate than mine, though. I’m not sure what’s the meaning of the name that Yuti gave, though.
(Hmm. I’m a little dissatisfied, but it looks like a name has been decided.)
“Ah, yes.”
(Then, let’s start training right away. Unleash the power of Evil.)
“Huh?”
I made a dumb voice at the unexpected remark from Master Usagi. When I looked closely, I saw that Yuti was also surprised.
“Warning. Yuuya’s power is dangerous. If you release it carelessly, it will…”
(That’s why you have to get used to it regularly. It’s not just me now; you’re here too. The situation is also different from time when the Fist Saint attacked, so it won’t go as far as a complete release like that time.)
“I-is that so?”
As I tilted my neck, Kuro complimented me languidly.
“Don’t worry. Unlike that time when you accepted me, you should be able to use some of the Evil power to some extent now. At that time, I was the catalyst, and it was as if you had created the Evil yourself. If it’s a power that you have created yourself, your body will naturally know how to release it.”
“I-is that so…?”
“And even if you unleash it, you don’t have any negative emotions in you right now that could be used as energy for the Evil. It will not go out of control.”
In addition to releasing the power of Evil at will, there seems to be no need to worry about it going out of control.
“In that case, please help me with my training.”
(Hmm. Leave it to me. I’ll go harder than before.)
“Please just go easy on me…”
With the help of the motivated Master Usagi and Yuti, I began to train in earnest to master the power of Evil.

Part 3
  “…Now, I wonder how long it will take for Yuuya to master the power of Evil.”
When Yuuya began to train with Master Usagi, Ouma, who was taking a nap in the house on Earth, opened one eye and muttered.
“Geez… Holy, Evil, and all that nonsense. That’s too much trouble for Yuuya, who has to train to handle the acquired extra power .”
“Woof?”
Night, who was also resting in the house on Earth, tilted his head in response to Ouma’s murmur.
“I’m pitying Yuuya, who is caught up in these things in the other world, even though he belongs to this world called Earth where there is no Holy or Evil.”
“Woof… woof.”
Night made a small thoughtful gesture and then nodded in affirmation to Ouma’s words.
“Don’t you think so, Night? The Evil are also troublesome existences. If they are attacking in order to gain control of the world… let’s just destroy the entire planet.”
“Woof.”
As Night barked strongly as if to say that it is no good, Ouma let out a sigh of annoyance.
“Don’t get so angry. It’s just a joke. Yuuya wouldn’t want that… and more importantly, that guy wouldn’t want that either.”
As he said that, Ouma stared into the distance, thinking of the Sage who was no longer in the world.
Then, interrupting the gloomy conversation, the sleeping Akatsuki woke up with his stomach exposed.
“Fugo… fugo?”
“Hmm? So you’re awake too, Akatsuki?”
“Fugo… Buhi. Buhi…”
Akatsuki woke up and thought that he should get up, but then he realized that Yuuya was not at home and started to sleep again.
“…This guy’s really got his own pace. Isn’t it better if Yuuya is a little more like Akatsuki?”
“W-woof…”
Night couldn’t say anything to Ouma’s words.
“Well, that’s fine. Yuuya also just started his training, so I will take another nap too──.”
The moment Ouma was about to say that.
“───Hmm?”
“Woof?”
Ouma suddenly sat up with an inexplicable expression on his face and stared towards the front door. His eyes seemed to be fixed on the Earth itself rather than the front door though.
Night tilted his head in wonder at Ouma’s behavior.
    “Didn’t you notice, Night?”
“Woof…”
“…Hmm. It might be difficult for the current Night. I guess you’ll find out when you grow up…”
As Ouma said that, he turned his attention to the Earth.
…I felt a faint presence of Evil from this world called Earth… but it doesn’t seem to be the power of Evil itself… Anyway, it is strange that such a being is on this planet. I’ve never felt anything like this before. Ouma said to himself.
Ouma had sensed a faint presence of Evil from the Earth.
Why is there a presence of Evil from the Earth? Also, where did the presence of Evil come from…? It was an instantaneous event, so even Ouma did not know.
I didn’t imagine this… I felt it for sure, albeit faintly. But the presence of it has completely disappeared now… Hmm. I don’t understand. Ouma continued.
Although he thought about it, Ouma had no way of confirming the situation since Yuuya told him not to go outside the house because there are no dragons on Earth.
“It’s really inconvenient at times like this. Why don’t I just go out without telling Yuuya?”
“Woof!? Woof!”
Night, startled by Ouma’s words, rushed to stop him, and Ouma let out a sigh.
“Sigh… Just kidding, just kidding. I’m not going to do anything like that. But you should also be aware of my desire to go out there.”
“W-woof.”
Unlike himself, Ouma was not allowed to leave the house on Earth freely, so Night could not say anything more. It’s not Night’s fault, but seeing that Night was pouting, Ouma smiled bitterly.
Geez… he’s so cute and obedient, even though he’s a Black Fenrir, a legendary race that rivals my own. But… should I tell Yuuya that there was a presence of Evil from the Earth? said Ouma.
This was the moment when Ouma thought so.
*Ring, ring*
“Mmm! It’s time to eat!”
The clock had just rung for lunch, and Ouma’s attention went straight to lunch.
For Ouma, who couldn’t look around the Earth, eating was one of the few things that allowed him to experience the other world, and that was why he looked forward to mealtime more than anything else.
Because of this, the thoughts about the presence of Evil that he felt on Earth had slipped entirely from Ouma’s mind. From Yuuya’s perspective, it was a big problem, but from Ouma’s perspective, it didn’t matter where the Evil appeared; he was more interested in the food.
This was the gap between the priorities of Yuuya and Ouma, who was an absolute powerhouse.
“Fumu. What’s today’s meal? I want to eat curry after a long time.”
Ouma said so and then went to urge Yuuya to cook with an exciting look.
──How will this affect Yuuya… no one knows yet.
  ＊＊＊
  It had been a few days since I started to train the power of Evil with the help of Master Usagi and Yuti. It was true that I was able to release the power of Evil, as Kuro had said. Still, it wasn’t easy to adjust the output as I wanted, or rather, to adjust the power.
When I unleashed the power of Evil, my stats certainly increased, and I was able to unleash attacks with tremendous power.
But it was too powerful, and I was overwhelmed by it. If I were to fight in the city like the time when I first met Yuti, the damage to the people around me would be tremendous.
In addition, the power of Evil could not be released for a long period of time. During the training when we were sparring as a pair, the power of Evil was suddenly cut off, and suddenly the fight was done in a normal state.
When I had the power of Evil, I was able to fight evenly with Master Usagi, but I was beaten to a pulp as soon as I lost my power.
By the way, when I asked Master Usagi if he could double his stats when he fought with me because my power was from the Evil. He said that he could adjust his stats, so when he fought with me, he fought with normal stats.
The reason why he still beat me up was purely because of the huge difference in level and the large gap in stats between us.
And even now, while using the power of Evil, I was in an even match with Master Usagi.
“Haah!”
(Hmph!)
My kick, clothed in the power of Evil, was swept away by Master Usagi’s kick like a soft willow, and he counterattacked.
By the way, when I used the power of Evil, a black aura overflowed from my body, and my eyes changed to red.
“Hey, hey, hey, you’re getting it.”
“I know!”
And when I use the power of Evil, I ask Kuro to help me. Kuro controls the power of Evil inside me so that I can somehow control it.
Or how should I say this? Master Usagi is a monster. After all… all of my attacks are blocked! However, by watching the movements of Master Usagi, I have been able to adapt his techniques gradually.
I’m not sure, but lately, I’ve been able to catch the movements of Master Usagi and Yuti with my eyes. I wonder why?
As I continued to do such practices, I suddenly felt as if I had forgotten something important.
Huh? What was it?
Then, Master Usagi, who sensed that I was distracted, intensified his attacks.
(To be thinking about something else while you’re training, you’ve got some nerve, huh…!?)
“Huh? T-that… Whoa!?”
While dealing with Master Usagi’s attack, my thoughts were still struggling to remember something that I had forgotten.
What… am I forgetting?
As my mind worked frantically, I finally remembered what I had forgotten!
“Ah…. aaaaah! I’m going to have a test soon!”
It completely slipped my mind! I’ve been preparing and reviewing every day, but…
“I-it’s not good! I have to study for my test…!”
(Concentrate on your training.)
“B-but, if I don’t study for the test, I won’t be able to concentrate on my training──.”
(Shut up.)
“Guh?”
Finally, I was attacked by Master Usagi and blown away.
“I… I have to study…”
As I said that for the last time, I lost consciousness.
──I’m not sure if I can say that things are going well… but my training to handle the power of Evil continues.

Chapter 2 – To The Sea With Everyone
Part 1
  I managed to convince Master Usagi to allow me to seriously study and prepare for the test to my satisfaction. And today was the last day of the regular tests.
“I-it’s over!”
Kaede shouted in a voice that could be heard throughout the classroom as she stretched as hard as she could after handing in the last test. As she did so, I tried my best to avert my gaze from Kaede’s chest.
When I looked closely, I saw that the other boys were staring at Kaede. Is it okay to look at her so much…? She will get angry…
As I thought about it, Rin approached Kaede.
“Hey, Kaede? That is, as expected, your service is too good, isn’t it?”
“Fuee? Service?”
“Your breasts.”
As Rin pointed out, Kaede slowly checked her situation.
And then…
“~~!”
Her face turned bright red, and she immediately stopped stretching. Seeing this, I could hear the blatantly disappointed voices of the boys in the surrounding.
“Ah…!”
“That Kanzaki, she did something unnecessary…!”
“It was a momentary Shangri-la…”
“──Boys, I can hear everything, okay?”
As soon as Rin said that with her veins stood out, the boys all straightened their posture. T-they are so easy to understand…
Kaede, who noticed that I was watching their exchange, came over to me, her cheeks still red.
“H-how was your test, Yuuya-kun?”
“Eh? Ah, yeah. I was wondering if it was able to reflect what I studied properly…”
“Is that so? …I asked Rin-chan to watch me study. And then I got a lot of the questions that Rin-chan predicted!”
“Eh, that’s great!”
When Kaede’s words made me involuntarily turn my gaze towards Rin, she was scratching her head in embarrassment.
“It’s not a big deal. Anyone can make predictions if they know the characteristics of the teacher.”
“…That’s absolutely not true.”
“I don’t think it’s that easy either…”
In the first place, what does it mean to grasp the characteristics of the teacher?
Well, I’m not very good at it to begin with, so I studied the whole test range.
Still, perhaps because I’ve leveled up, my memory was definitely improving. Also, my eyesight had gotten better as well. The things I had studied instantly flowed into my head… What is it? This feeling.
Before I leveled up, I couldn’t even learn anything from my studies.
When I was thinking about this, the others who were getting along with me, such as Ryo and Shingo-kun, gathered around.
“Oh, everyone is here.”
“Hey, how was everyone’s test?”
“Well, I think I did better than I expected.”
“I didn’t have any problems either.”
“I think I’m fine, but… No, I want to think I’m fine.”
“No, I looked after you, so don’t say such pitiful things…”
Rin looked at Kaede’s reluctant face with a dumbfounded look.
As I smiled bitterly at the interaction, I noticed that Yukine, who was in the seat next to mine, was in a daze.
“Hmm? What’s wrong, Yukine?”
“…I’m just tired…”
“I-is that so? …By the way, how was your test?”
“…I just want to think about the fun things in life right now.”
In other words, it was not so good.
While we were having this conversation, other students were heading home or to their club activities.
“Oh, by the way… is Kaede doing okay with her club activities?”
When Ryo suddenly asked that, Kaede nodded.
“Yeah. The club activities themselves start tomorrow.”
“Oh yeah, how is your club activity, Yukine?”
“Eh? Hyoudou has club activities?”
Ryo looked at Yukine with surprise… Yukine joined a club activity. What kind of club is it? Is it a light music club?
“…Hmm. It’s the occult research club.”
“You’ve gone to an unexpected club!”
However, Kaede and Rin seemed to know about it and didn’t seem particularly surprised.
“…I’m free from any kind of club activities today. And I haven’t brought any experiment books with me today either.”
“Y-you have to be very careful with that…”
For some reason, Kaede said that to Yukine with a twitch in her cheeks. Did something happen to them?
“Well, that’s right! Now that the test is over, summer vacation is just around the corner!”
“Ah, you’re right.”
“…I’ve had my hands full with tests lately.”
“Yeah, that’s happened to me too!”
“…Kaede and Yukine, you should take more time to study.”
“Ahahaha…”
I realized from Kaede’s words that the summer vacation was indeed coming soon.
That said, I have no particular plans… and if I had to pick an activity, it would be to spend more time in the other world. I want to check out the whole area in the Great Devil’s Nest as soon as possible.
When I was thinking about that, Kaede suggested with sparkling eyes.
“So why don’t we all have some fun together! There’s also a summer festival, right?”
“That’s fine, but you know that summer vacation is not only about playing, right?”
“Eh? Is it not?”
“…You’ve got a serious problem there.”
“U-um… we have to do our summer homework, too, don’t we?”
“”Ugh!””
“And I’ve heard there’s a lot of it.”
“”Uh!””
Kaede and Yukine were astonished by Shingo-kun and Rin’s words. Eh, did they really think there was no possibility of that? …No, I guess some schools don’t have it.
The two of them realized that it was not just a fun summer vacation. As they turned white as burned-out ashes, the classroom door unexpectedly opened.
“──Um, is Yuuya-san here?”
“Eh? Ah, Kaori?”
“Oh, Yuuya-san!”
The one who came to the classroom was Kaori. As soon as Kaori noticed my presence, she came straight to me.
“Thank goodness you haven’t left yet.”
“Well, yeah. Did you need me for something?”
“That’s right! And since everyone is here… it’s just perfect.”
Everyone seems to be wondering about it.
When everyone tilted their heads at Kaori’s words, Kaori smiled.
“Yes! Now that the test is over, summer vacation will soon be coming. So if you don’t mind, I thought I’d invite you all to my vacation resort…”
“A vacation resort?” said everyone in unison.
We were surprised by the unexpected invitation, raising our voices. V-vacation resort, she said? …By the way, I’ve almost forgotten that Kaori’s family is wealthy.
“My family vacation resort has a beach nearby, and I was wondering if you guys would like to join me…”
“Really? Yay! It’s a beach, a beach!”
“T-that would be great for us, but…”
“That’s right!”
“…But, is it okay?”
“Of course! You all have been treating me so well…”
“What do you mean by… treating you well?”
“Y-yeah. I don’t remember doing anything much for you…”
“Of course not! You all invited me to play with you, and now I want to invite you to play with me too!”
It’s not that Kaede and the others had any particular reason for doing so; they were just normal friends and had been inviting people over to play until now. Kaori had never had a chance to hang out with someone her own age, so this was a new experience for her and made her happy.
Then Ryo, who was watching Kaori and the others’ reaction, scratched his cheek as if he was troubled.
“Ah…, um, is it okay if we join you too?”
“Of course. We’ve played together before! So please join us too, Ryo-san and Shingo-san.”
In response to Kaori’s words, Ryo and Shingo were also invited.
“So, I’ll let you know when we decide on the details.”
Kaori said and left the classroom.
When Kaede saw her off, she shouted with joy.
“~~! Yay! We can all go to the beach together! Right?”
“W-well, I didn’t expect Kaori-san to invite me too…”
“That’s true. But since we’re here, let’s have some fun!”
“Yeah!”
While Kaede was excited by Ryo’s words, Rin grinned.
“But you have to do your homework before you can play.”
“”Ugh!””
Rin’s words seemed to have an effect on Yukine too, and she groaned along with Kaede.
  ＊＊＊
  After being invited to Kaori’s vacation resort, we decided on a date that would work for all of us, and we finally entered the summer vacation.
And now we were in front of Kaori’s vacation resort.
“S-so big…”
“No, I could only imagine it as the same size as the school…”
“Y-yeah. When I saw it in person, it was just…”
Ryo, Shingo-kun, and I were stunned to see the vacation resort where we would be staying.
The vacation resort we were invited to was a log cottage built surrounded by nature, in one of the most popular places for rich people to build vacation resorts. However, the cottage was fully air-conditioned, and there were even convenience stores and supermarkets nearby, so I guess it was a wonderful place to stay.
And above all, there is──.
“Whoa! Beach, it’s the beach, Rin-chan!”
“Yes, yes, I see it.”
“…Hmm, the view is beautiful.”
There was a swimming beach, just a short walk from the cottage. Kaede’s eyes sparkled looking at the beach, and Kaori, who was preparing the cottage, came over with a smile.
“I’m glad you enjoyed it.”
“Of course, I am!”
“…Thank you.”
“Fufufu… I will show you to your rooms, so please follow me with your luggage.”
“Yeees!” said everyone.
Kaori urged us to head inside the cottage.
Naturally, the bedrooms were separate for men and women, but the room where we boys slept was so spacious that there was plenty of room for all three of us to sleep together. The women’s room must be quite spacious as well.
…Or rather, now that I’ve realized it, I can’t believe I’m spending time under the same roof with girls…
Of course, there’s Yuti staying in my house now, but I’m not used to that yet either.
In such a situation, I still can’t believe that I’m having a private sleepover with other girls like this.
As I was putting my luggage in my room and taking a breather, Kaede and the others came to the boys’ room.
“Come on! Guys! We’re going to the beach!”
“Y-you’re so energetic, huh, Kaede-san…”
“That’s obvious, Shingo-kun! I’ve been looking forward to this day!”
“Well, she even worked unusually hard on her summer vacation homework.”
“…I don’t want to remember that. But I did my best.”
As Rin said, we each finished our summer vacation homework early for this day.
I’ve always been the type of person who finishes my homework early, but Kaede and Yukine were different; they were almost dying from the homework before they came to this place.
“Alright, then, let’s get changed quickly and go play on the beach right away, shall we?”
“Yeah! That’s why we’re going to go change our clothes!”
After saying that, Kaede and the others went back to the girls’ room.
Then one of the girls, Kaori, stayed behind and beckoned me over.
“Um, Yuuya-san.”
“Hmm? What’s wrong?”
“Speaking of which, is everything okay with Yuti, Ouma-san, and the others?”
“Ah…”
I smiled bitterly at Kaori’s words.
“Yuti said she’d rather not participate. She doesn’t like to be around a lot of people.”
“That’s true too… So, was it bothering her when I suggested she transfer to the school?”
“Oh, no problem! Apparently, she’s having fun at school and making friends.”
“I’m glad to hear that!”
It seems that Yuti had made friends at school, which was a relief to me. She even promised to hang out with her friends during this summer vacation.
“Also, Ouma-san said he’s refraining for the same reason as Yuti.”
“Is that so?”
“Yeah. However, I have to prepare food for Ouma-san, Night, and Akatsuki, so I have to go back using magic for that.”
“…Really, Yuuya-san’s magic is very useful.”
Kaori smiled bitterly at my words. As Kaori said, the teleport magic is very convenient. That’s why I had to be careful to not be seen by others.
After listening to my explanation, Kaori went back to change with Kaede and the others, and I changed into the swimsuit I had prepared for the day and headed to the beach with Ryo and the others.

Part 2
  “Oh, it’s so crowded.”
“Y-yeah.”
“I wonder if we can find a spot?”
Ryo, Shingo-kun, and I arrived at the beach ahead of the others, carrying parasols in our hands and looking for a vacant spot. But since the temperature was high and it was a perfect day for swimming, there were a lot of people.
“Hmm… Oh, it’s a bit far, but wouldn’t that be a good place?”
The place Ryo pointed to was indeed a little far from the crowd, and there was a space available.
“Well then, Yuuya. It’s a little far, but it’s a good place.”
“Eh? Sure, but… do you need help?”
“Shingo and I can set this up ourselves.”
“Y-yeah. So, Yuuya-kun, why don’t you go and call Kaede-san and the others?”
“Okay.”
Ryo and Shingo-kun asked me to go and bring Kaede and the others.
“Even so… Do I look weird?”
When I said that, I looked down at my appearance. The only swimwear I’ve ever owned was the one I use for school classes.
When I talked to Ryo and the others about it, they said that I should have a swimsuit for having fun, so I decided to go a little overboard and buy one… Thanks to the materials I got in the other world, I earned some money when I exchanged them for cash. It’s a bit of a luxury.
As I was checking my appearance, I suddenly noticed that people around me were looking at me.
“…Isn’t that guy really cool? Shall we go talk to him?”
“Yeah. But I think I’ve seen him somewhere before… Ah! Isn’t that the guy who was in a magazine before?”
“That’s right! Whoa… I thought the photos were edited, but he looks really cool…”
“I mean, look at those abs! Isn’t it amazing? They’re so tight!”
“Hmm, those are really nice muscles. They’re really well-trained.”
“Those abs are like chocolate bars! You could grate daikon with those oblique muscles!”
…I hear some unusual voices, but it’s probably just my imagination.
While feeling strangely uncomfortable and waiting for Kaede to arrive, I suddenly heard a voice calling out to me.
“U-um…”
“Yes?”
When I turned my gaze toward the voice, I saw several unfamiliar women standing there.
“C-can I help you?”
When I asked them, I was so nervous that I was at a loss for words, and they looked at each other.
“I knew it!”
“Yes! …Um, you’re the one who was in the magazine with Miu-chan before, aren’t you?”
“Eh? Ah… yes. That’s right, but…”
“U-um! Can I take a photo with you?”
“P-photo?”
Why do they want my photo?
As I panicked, the women closed the distance between us and took out their phones to snap a picture with me.
“Um, thank you!”
“Eh, no, it’s…”
After taking the pictures, the women left looking happy, although I had no idea why. Oh, I guess this is what people call coming in like a storm and leaving like a storm…
As I watched them leave in a daze, I heard Kaori’s voice.
“Yuuya-san!”
“Eh? Ah, Kaori…!”
Then I saw Kaori’s figure and was transfixed. She was wearing a cute white swimsuit and a hoodie, and when she noticed me, she shyly averted her gaze.
    “U-um… My swimsuit… Isn’t it weird…?”
“Huh? N-no! Not at all! It looks good on you! It suits you well!”
I was so nervous that I didn’t know what I was saying, but Kaori smiled happily at my words.
“I-is that so… I’m so glad that Yuuya-san said that.”
“…..”
This is not good. Until I came here, I was completely unaware of the fact that… playing on the beach means that everyone will be wearing a swimsuit! That’s right! They said they were going to change their clothes, right?
Because of the school lessons, I didn’t think anything of it, but after thinking about it, I realized that this is how women get into their beautiful swimsuits.
…Huh? This means that───.
“Ah, Yuuya-kun! Oooii!”
“Fuh… It’s so hot outside!”
“…I feel like I’m melting.”
After Kaori, Kaede, and the others came to me, despite my nervousness and stiffness.
Kaede wore a cute frilly swimsuit and hot pants, Rin wore a black sporty swimsuit, and Yukine wore a salopette swimsuit and carried a floating ring.
Each of them looked great… W-what should I do? I’m not sure where to put my eyes. They are all very attractive, so I had trouble finding a place to look.
“H-hey, look over there…”
“Whoa! Their level is too high!”
“Can we talk to them?”
“No, they’re that guy’s friends, aren’t they?”
“I-I’m so jealous!”
The men around me were admiring Kaori and the others in their swimsuits. When I looked closely, I saw that some of the women were also admiring them. They are beautiful even from a woman’s perspective…
The sight of Kaori and the others made me feel unrealistic, and I couldn’t help but think that while having a faraway look in my eyes.
Then, Kaede peeped into my face curiously at my situation.
“Yuuya-kun? What’s wrong?”
“Huh? Ah, no, it’s nothing!”
“Really? So, um… what do you think of me?”
“Uee? It looks good on you! Y-yeah!”
When Kaede asked me that, my cheeks flushed red, I replied in a hoarse voice.
“Is that right? …I see… Ehehehe…”
“Mm…”
I didn’t know what the right response would be, as I had only recently been able to have a proper conversation with the opposite sex. However, there was no indication that Kaede was unhappy with the answer, so I think I didn’t make a fatal mistake.
“…Yuuya. What about me?”
I didn’t know anything about this topic, but as if chasing after me, Yukine continued the conversation by asking me something like that!
“Um…”
I’m not sure what to say in this situation. Is it enough to say that she looks good as well? What does Yukine want from me in the first place?
When I was confused about how to answer, Yukine put her hand on her chest and looked at Kaede for some reason.
“…As expected, it’s the breasts.”
“How did you come to that conclusion?”
I didn’t think of anything in particular, and I didn’t say anything, but Yukine glared at Kaede’s breasts with resentment and then looked at me with a frustrated gaze. I didn’t even think about the breasts one bit, you know? It’s a false accusation!
While I was puzzled about the opinions of Kaede and Yukine regarding their swimsuits following Kaori’s, I was so flustered and I didn’t notice that Kaori’s cheeks were puffed up. But seeing my continued fumbling, Rin came up to me with a grin and poked me with her elbow.
“Oya? Oyaoya? Yuuya. Are you nervous seeing Kaede and the others in their swimsuits?”
“Uh, t-that’s… of course it is…”
“Ahahahaha! That’s surprising. You look like you’re already being used to this kind of situation, though.”
My answer made Rin laugh out loud.
She said that I’m used to it… There’s no way. Where does that come from anyway? I don’t know…
“Well, unlike me, Kaede has a great style, Kaori is beautiful, and Yukine is cute.”
“Eh? No, Rin is also very beautiful, though…”
“Huh?”
Because she said something strange, I couldn’t help but tell her what I was thinking, and she raised her voice in an unusually indifferent way.
In response to Rin’s reaction, I realized that I had just said something embarrassing.
No, it was because Rin said something weird that I reflexively replied! I’m not the kind of guy who can say something like that without hesitation. I want to be able to say that out loud one day, though!
I mean, Kaori, Yukine, Kaede are all beautiful, but Rin is also very slender, like a model, and looks great in a mature swimsuit. I wasn’t sure why she was saying that.
“It’s just that I’m so nervous when people approach me so openly…”
“I-is that so? Ahahahaha…”
Rin said and quickly walked away from me.
On closer look, it’s unusual to find that Rin’s cheeks are dyed red, and she’s averting her gaze awkwardly. I-it makes me more embarrassed when she reacted like that…
“W-well then, let’s get going! Ryo and Shingo-kun have already gone ahead and saved a spot for us.”
“I see… If that’s the case, we should get there quickly and thank them…”
“You’re right!”
I was not too fond of the situation, so I told everyone about Ryo and Shingo-kun. The atmosphere returned to normal, so I took a breath. T-thank goodness… it’s too stimulating for me to deal with everyone by myself…
As soon as we met up with Ryo and Shingo-kun, we did some careful warm up exercises and then all headed to the beach to start playing. Ryo seemed to be able to do just about anything, and he showed off his athleticism on the beach as well, swimming far and wide.
Shingo-kun was not so good at swimming, so he played in the shallows with a beach ball that Kaori and I had brought with us.
Then, when Ryo came back from the long swim, Kaede suggested.
“Hey! Let’s all play beach volleyball together!”
“Oh, that sounds good!”
We all agreed to Kaede’s suggestion, and when it came time to divide the teams, Shingo-kun volunteered to be the referee.
So, we decided to make three teams: Kaori and I, Ryo and Yukine, and Rin and Kaede.
“Yuuya-san, let’s do our best!”
“Yes, let’s do our best.”
The moment I nodded to Kaori’s words, I remembered the ball game tournament the other day. On that day, due to some trouble, Kaori and I were paired up to play tennis… That was where I found out that I should not let Kaori play sports.
However, by the time I remembered that, the match was about to start, and our opponents were Kaede and Rin.
“We immediately get to face Yuuya-kun and Kaori, huh… Can we win this?”
“I don’t know. Please go easy on us, okay?”
“Well…”
I think I would have to work harder rather than being soft, though.
As I thought about it, the match began with Kaori’s serve…

Part 3
  “Eeii.”
“Ah!”
I shifted my body to the side in response to the ball coming at me from behind. The beach ball went right through where I had been a moment ago with great force.
“Ah! I’m sorry, Yuuya-san!”
“I-it’s okay.”
I can avoid it, but if Kaede and Kaori were teaming up, it might have been dangerous…
As I was thinking of that, Rin grinned when she saw Kaori’s serve.
“Heh? It seems that Kaori is not good at sports, huh? Let’s aim at her.”
“Eeh? A-as expected that’s…”
“Kaede. This is a match, you know. It’s a great strategy to win.”
And Rin began to aim at Kaori with the next serve as she declared.
“Soryaa!”
“Eii!”
Kaori managed to deal with Rin’s serve, but the ball flew in the wrong direction. That direction was out towards the sea. However, I thought that I shouldn’t let the ball go out. I ran along the surface of the sea without thinking, caught up with the ball, and returned it to Rin’s court.
    “Haah!”
“Wait… how can you pick that up!?”
“I mean, how can you run on the sea’s surface like that?”
“Eeh? Y-you must have seen it wrong.”
“No, I think so too, but…!”
I was chasing after the ball, but it was definitely not normal to run on the surface of the water! Or rather, I’m surprised that I can run on the sea’s surface myself.
It seems that during my training with Master Usagi, my leg strength had become extraordinary. However, after I returned the ball to Rin’s court, Kaori was the only one left on our court. Rin took advantage of that and scored a point.
I tried to get back onto the court, but my feet got caught in the sand. Well… I don’t have much experience moving in the sand. It’s hard to move, and it takes more energy than usual… This seems to be a good practice for me.
Although I was here to play, I couldn’t help but think about such things due to my training with Master Usagi.
After that, Kaori was intensively targeted, and Kaede’s team defeated our team.
“Ugh… Yuuya-san, I’m sorry… I’m just slowing you down…”
“Well, don’t mention it.”
At the time of the ball game tournament, it was still possible to cover since we played tennis, but it wasn’t as easy to do so in beach volleyball. Of course, Kaori always tried to keep the ball in play with volleys and receives, but all of them flew at me with lethal force.
…On the other hand, if there was a competition where that ball could be fully utilized, I think Kaori could compete well enough. After all, it was not only unpredictable but also very fast, so that even I had to rush to avoid it. I think it’s at a level that even the monsters I’ve fought in the Great Devil’s Nest would be afraid. I was really surprised.
After that, we also played against Ryo’s team, but the result was still our loss. Kaede’s team won in the end.
“Ugh… Yuuya-san, I’m sorry… that we lost because of me…”
“N-no! You don’t have to worry about it…!”
I’m not sure what the right thing to say to her would be, so I just panicked. But then, with a grin on her face, Rin called out to Kaori.
“Kaori’s team lost all of their games… Isn’t that a sign of a disaster?”
“Y-you don’t have to say that!”
Rin laughed out loud at Kaori’s reaction.
We enjoyed playing beach volleyball for a while and decided to take a break since we played for a long time.
“Let’s take a break and eat somewhere, shall we?”
“Yes!”
We all agreed to Ryo’s suggestion and decided to have lunch at a beach house. The place we were at was far away from the crowds, so there were only a few people at the nearby beach house.
When we turned our attention to the more crowded area of the beach, we noticed that the beach houses there were very busy.
“Even though there seemed to be more people over there, is this beach house okay with you guys?”
“I think it’s fine.”
“Yeah, I guess so. It’s probably only crowded there because it’s in a good location. The taste won’t have much difference.”
So we headed to the nearest beach house──.
“Oh, Tenjou and the others. What a coincidence.”
“W-what?”
“…I’m surprised.”
“W-what’s Sawada-sensei doing here?”
Our homeroom teacher, Sawada-sensei, acted as a waitress at the beach house we were headed to!
What’s more, she was wearing an apron over a black bikini. Unlike her usual loose shirt and lab coat. I-I don’t know where to look… No, I always have trouble looking at her!
We were surprised, but Ryo, who came to his senses quickly, hurriedly asked.
“Sensei! What are you doing here? You’re a teacher, aren’t you? Huh…? Is it okay to have a second job?”
“If you ask me that…”
Of course, I was surprised because I hadn’t expected to meet her in such a place.
She had an image as someone who didn’t go out much and might be doing experiments at some facility aside from being a teacher, but now when seeing that she was working as a clerk, I thought it would be unsuitable for her profession to have a second job.
Moreover, Kaori, the daughter of Tsukasa-san, the chairman of the board of directors, was also here right now, and I felt like Sawada-sensei couldn’t make any excuses for it…
Then, Sawada-sensei replied in a tone with no particular agitation and without hesitation.
“It’s not a side job. Because this is my parents’ house.”
“Eh?”
When I was surprised again by the unexpected answer, a stern man came out from the beach house. The man was wearing the same apron as Sawada-sensei, but he had a very tough expression on his face, which was somewhat mismatched. He also had a large scar on his face, and with his body being large and muscular, he was quite intimidating. Um… he didn’t look like an average person…
“Hey, Rie! Don’t slack off!”
The man probably called Sawada-sensei by her first name and yelled at her.
His loud voice, coupled with his appearance, was quite intimidating. We froze, but Sawada-sensei didn’t seem to mind and replied in her usual tone.
“No, Dad. These are my students.”
“Your students?”
“Dad?”
We and the man──Sawada-sensei’s father──overlapped our surprised voices. Eh, he is her father?
Even though I knew it was rude, I couldn’t help but compare the two of them. D-do they even resemble each other?
We were dumbfounded, but as soon as the surprise subsided, the man’s expression changed, and he spoke to us with a smile.
“Ah, it can’t be helped if you kids are Rie’s students! Since this girl is like this, you kids must be having a hard time, right? Is she a good teacher?”
“Y-yeah, she’s a very good teacher…”
When Kaori, the chairman’s daughter, answered in confusion, Sawada-sensei’s mouth twitched.
“You don’t trust me, do you? I am an excellent teacher, you know?”
“Even if you’re talented, I don’t know if that makes you a good teacher. That’s for the students to decide.”
“That’s a good point, I guess.”
Sawada-sensei laughed and nodded. Sawada-sensei’s father looked at us in amazement.
“Oh? When I looked closely, I realized that all of the girls were beautiful! And the guys are handsome, too. What’s this? Are all the kids at your school like this?”
“Hmm. All the students are like this.”
“What kind of monster school is that…?”
No, Father-san. I think so too. There are a lot of students with good personalities and have appearances that are beautiful or cool like Kaori and Ryo.
“Well, as you may have figured out from the conversation, I’m Rie’s father, Ginji. Since you’re here, I’m going to treat you all to lunch.”
“Eh? N-no. We’re sorry for the trouble!”
“Don’t worry about it! Hey, Rie! You’re not busy anyway, right? Show them to the tatami room while I’m making the food!”
“Hmm, I’m not busy, but that’s because there are no customers.”
“Shut up!”
C-certainly, there are a lot of people on the beach, but there are no customers here… Is it possible that being just a little bit farther away from the beach can make such a difference?
Sawada Sensei’s father… Ginji-san shouted at her, but Sawada Sensei walked out of the reception area and came over to us.
“So that’s it. Sensei’s family runs this beach house. That’s how I was forced to help out during the summer vacation if I was free. Of course, I don’t get paid.”
“I-I see…?”
In other words, it doesn’t pay as it’s an extension of helping out at home, so it’s not a side job. I don’t know if that’s really true, but it’s not something we can talk about. Kaori might be able to say something, though.
Sawada-sensei led us to the tatami room, and after waiting for a while, Ginji-san brought us some food.
“Hey, you’re all still growing up, right? Eat a lot, eat a lot!”
“Yeah!”
What came out in front of us was a large bowl of yakisoba, the aroma of the sauce stimulating our appetite. When we took advantage of Ginji-san’s kindness and tried the yakisoba, we were surprised at the taste.
“Delicious!”
“Amazing… I think I’ve never had such delicious yakisoba before.”
“…*munch**munch*.“
The yakisoba we were served was delicious. Of course, eating yakisoba at a beach house, combined with the situation, might have made it taste better than usual. However, the yakisoba made by Ginji-san was even better than that.
As everyone was absorbed in eating the yakisoba, Kaede muttered to herself.
“Why are there so few customers when it’s so good?”
“Kaede.”
“…Ah! I-I’m sorry!”
Kaede hurriedly apologized when Rin warned her in a dumbfounded manner. But Ginji-san didn’t get angry about it as he smiled bitterly.
“It’s okay; it’s okay. It’s the truth anyway.”
“Well, the location is bad. It’s located at the edge of the beach, and when you compare it to the most crowded part of the beach, there are far fewer people here. That’s why we don’t get many customers.”
“Besides, I’m pretty sure the store over there has a better variety of food than this one.”
“I see…”
Indeed, when I looked at the menu for Ginji-san’s beach house, there were only curry and beer on the menu aside from yakisoba.
“I-it’s such a shame when the food is so good…”
“…It’s a pity.”
As Shingo-kun and Yukine said that, Sawada-sensei seemed to notice something and stood up.
“Right!”
“Oh? What’s the matter, Rie?”
“Sensei’s got a great idea.”
“Good idea?”
We tilted our heads in confusion, but Sawada-sensei nodded confidently.
“Yeah, a good idea.”

Part 4
  “Okay, table three, two yakisoba noodles, please!”
“Here, one glass of beer!”
“U-um, Two curries, please!”
──Before we knew it, we were working at Ginji-san’s beach house temporarily, which was different from our original purpose of playing on the beach.
Sawada-sensei’s good idea was for us to work as helpers. I suddenly thought back to Sawada-sensei’s behavior at that time.
Sawada-sensei said, “There are some of the most beautiful men and women in the school here. So I’d like to ask you to be our sales staff.”
“S-sales staff?”
“Of course, we’ll pay you.”
 ──With that in mind, we began our work here. Moreover, Ginji-san seemed to be somewhat troubled by the lack of customers, so when he asked us to help him, we took the job.
Well, Ginji-san treated us to yakisoba. I also had a chance to taste his curry as well, which was also very tasty. So, I think Ginji-san’s food will attract many repeat customers, and I’m going to help him with that.
As soon as we started working as wait staff, many male customers came to see the beautiful Kaori and the others, and thanks to the handsome Ryo and the cute little animal-like Shingo-kun, many female customers came as well.
As the number of customers increased, Ginji-san was cooking at an incredible pace.
“Ahhhh! That’s a happy cry, oi!”
“Oh, Dad, keep up the good work!”
“Rie, you should at least be able to cook as well!”
However, since Sawada-sensei couldn’t cook, she couldn’t help Ginji-san. Instead, she was doing her best to wash the dishes. Ryo and I offered to help with the dishes, but Ginji-san said he would take care of that himself, so we put all our effort into carrying the food out.
“───Two yakisoba and two beers, correct?”
“”…..””
“U-um?”
“Please shake my hand!”
“Yes?”
“Oh, that’s not fair!”
“Please take a picture with me…!”
…I got some weird orders like this quite often, but I think things were generally going well. As the number of customers increased, word of mouth seemed to spread, and eventually, enough customers came to fill Ginji-san’s beach house.
“Aren’t all the waitresses here high level?”
“The girls are super cute!”
“And the boys are amazing too!”
“I mean, is this some sort of event?”
“The yakisoba is delicious, though!”
“The curry is good too!”
I could hear the various customers’ voices, and it seemed that they didn’t have anything bad to say. Ginji-san’s food was delicious, wasn’t it?
Now I not only had to carry out the food, but also clean up the dishes after the customers left, and it was getting too much for me to handle. So I increased the number of dishes I carried at a time.
“H-hey, that’s…”
“Eh, amazing…”
“How many could he carry…?”
I put trays on my hands and arms, placed dishes on top of them, as well as stacked them on my head, and carried a considerable amount of after-dinner dishes. It’s a lot of work, but my improved body had the balance and strength to carry it without difficulty. I’m glad that I’m useful in these areas.
“Tenjou. I need your help.”
“Yes? What’s the matter?”
“We’re about to run out of food, so I need your help to buy more. You seem to have the most strength.”
“I-is that so?”
“What are you talking about? You’re the guy who wrestled a bear on the field trip, aren’t you?”
That’s right. So, while Sawada-sensei was taking me to buy food, an incident happened.
  ＊＊＊
  “U-um, please don’t!”
“Eehh? Come on, let’s have some fun together.”
“Yes, yes, we’ll show you how to have fun.”
A group of male customers with tanned skin were grabbing Kaori’s arms. Seeing that, Kaede, who was nearby, called out to them.
“Um, can’t you stop doing that? You’re troubling her.”
“Oh, you’re cute, too!”
“Yes, you can hang out with us, too!”
“Come on, come on, let’s bring your other friends.”
“P-please stop!”
“Hey, you guys──.”
Ryo, who was nearby, tried to stop them, but one of the male customers, a muscular man, stood in his way.
“Don’t get in our way.”
“I’m not interfering; I’m telling you to stop.”
“If you want me to stop, go ahead and try. What can you do, you skinny bastard? Huh?”
“Kuh…”
When one of the men surrounding Kaori and Kaede pushed Ryo away, he staggered heavily.
Ryo was good at sports, and he was by no means frail. However, all of the men surrounding Kaori and the others were much more muscular and taller than Ryo, making them quite intimidating.
In terms of the number of people, the situation was not good, and the atmosphere in the whole store was getting worse──.
“───Oh, excuse me, I need to pass by.”
“Yu-Yuuya-san!”
Yuuya, who was just coming back from shopping for groceries, came back with both hands full of shopping bags. However, having just returned from shopping, Yuuya couldn’t grasp the situation and headed to Kaori and the others without hesitation, as he had something to do.
“Excuse me. Please excuse me for a moment.”
“Huh?”
One of the men furrowed his eyebrows in displeasure at the unabashedly approaching Yuuya.
“Hey you, can’t you see that? We are having a nice conversation with these girls right now. Get lost.”
“Huh? Oh, I’m sorry. But we’re a little short-staffed, so we need these two to help us out…”
“Huh? You don’t understand the situation, do you?”
“Even if you say so…”
Since Sawada-sensei, who returned earlier with more ingredients, the orders that had been stopped began to move and the store became hectic again.
“For the time being, the two of them have work to do, so I’ll take them with me. I’ll listen to what you have to say instead…”
“You, you just…”
In order to stop Yuuya from taking Kaori and Kaede away, the man grabbed Yuuya’s arm, but he didn’t falter.
Then, Kaori and Kaede were freed from the man’s hands and immediately went into Ginji’s store. Seeing this, Yuuya felt relieved for a moment, took a breath, and tried to head back as well to put down the bags in his hands.
However, the men moved into a position to surround Yuuya.
“Hey, are you fucking kidding with us? Huh?”
“E-eeh? W-what’s───.”
“Shut the fuck up!”
“Kyaaaaaaa!”
The other female customers shouted at the man who suddenly attacked Yuuya. But Yuuya, who was attacked by the man, was in a panic about something else entirely.
(To suddenly attack me… It’s dangerous for the other customers and it will destroy the store’s property too!)
Not understanding the reason at all, Yuuya was just as confused about being attacked, but he was more worried about the customers around him than about being attacked, as the men went on a rampage.
As he avoided one man’s attack while thinking about that, the other men attacked Yuuya one after another. In order to do something, Yuuya tried to move but remembered that he still had the shopping bag in his hand.
Realizing that he would not be able to move properly, he threw the shopping bag into the air and gently caught the men’s fists and kicks, then straightened them all into an upright position and held them there. Just then, the shopping bag came back to Yuuya’s hand.
“Huh?”
“O-oh?”
The men didn’t know what had happened and, for some reason, cocked their heads at the fact that they were standing upright. When Yuuya confirmed that there was no damage to the surrounding objects or customers and that the men were not injured, he took a breath.
“Um, please don’t get violent. There are customers here…”
The men came to their senses when Yuuya told the bewildered men and tried to attack him again, but…
“O-oi, you──.”
“──I thought it was so noisy when I was concentrating on cooking in the kitchen… You people, what are you doing? Huh?”
“Ah? Hyii!?”
Ginji was glaring at the men with anger on his stern face. His expression was so terrifying that all of the men who had been so energetic earlier were scared out of their wits.
“You… you’ve got some nerve there. I wonder if you’re ready to be chopped up and used as a filling for yakisoba? Huh?”
“””I-I’m sorrrryyyyyyyy!”””
The men ran out of the beach house with tears in their eyes because of Ginji, who did not look like a regular person. All of them, including the surrounding guests, were stunned by the scene, and Yuuya immediately bowed his head.
“I’m sorry, Ginji-san. Thank you very much.”
“Hmm? I didn’t do anything. Are you guys okay?”
“Y-yes! We’re fine!”
“Ryo-kun and Yuuya-kun helped us…”
“No, I didn’t do anything. Yuuya was the one who saved you.”
“I see… Yuuya, you’re amazing! When I looked closely, I could see that you’ve been working out like crazy…”
“Tenjou is one of the most physically gifted in our school. All of the P.E teachers were amazed. They said he could be in the Olympics.”
“That’s just…”
Ginji’s cheeks twitched at the information provided by Sawada-sensei. And then the surrounding guests began to applaud.
“That was amazing!”
“Yeah, yeah! It was like watching a scene from a movie!”
“I mean, I’ve only seen moves like that in the manga!”
“It was so fast; I could barely understand it!”
“Um, well, that…”
Yuuya, who didn’t expect to be praised, was bewildered by the reaction of the people around him.
Ginji laughed at the situation and turned to his customers.
“Well, our waiter is awesome, right? Well, please continue to enjoy your meal.”
…Thus, despite the troubles, Ginji’s store, thanks to the hard work of Yuuya and the others, as well as Ginji’s cooking, achieved the highest sales ever.

Chapter 3 – The Mysterious Shrine Maiden
Part 1
  After we finished our unplanned work at the beach house owned by Sawada-sensei’s family, we went back to the beach to have fun. At that time, Ryo and Shingo-kun were approached by women. Many people also approached me, probably because I stood out at Ginji-san’s beach house, and that confused me.
However, we didn’t have to worry about anything happening to Kaori and the others again like at the beach house, thanks to the fact that we all stayed together as much as possible.
Then we went back to the cottage for our dinner and to have a rest.
In the meantime, I moved to a secluded place and went home to prepare dinner for Night and the others. Ouma-san seemed to have slept all day, and everyone stayed quietly at home.
When I finished preparing Night and the others’ meal and snuck back to the cottage, Yukine brought a book with her from her room.
“…Everyone, do you have a minute?”
“Hmm? What is it? Yukine-san.”
When Kaori tilted her head, Yukine held out the book in her hand and proposed to us.
“…Do you want to test your courage?”
“A test of courage?”
Rin and Kaede seemed to have realized something – especially Kaede, whose cheeks twitched.
“Yu-Yu-Yu-Yukine-chan? Are you serious about this… test of courage?”
“…I’m serious.”
“Noooooooo!”
“Ka-Kaede-san?”
We are confused by Kaede’s loud shout at Yukine’s words. W-what happened to her?
Then, Rin smiled bitterly and again told us about the occult research club that Yukine is a member of.
“So, is the test of courage… related to that club activity?”
“…It’s not just because of the club activities. But when I was researching the cottage area before coming here, I found a place that looked like a good place for a test of courage. So I just suggested it.”
“A good place for a test of courage?”
Kaede continued to react loudly to Yukine’s words. Maybe she’s not very good at ghosts and such… Fortunately, I’m not so bad at it, so I’m fine.
In a different world, I had fought with a ghost type monster called “Wraith.” I don’t know if the ghosts in this world have the same characteristics as the monster called Wraith, though.
“I used to come here a lot with my father, but I didn’t know there was such a place…”
“…Yeah. There seems to be a pretty old shrine.”
When Yukine replied to Kaori’s surprise, Ryo suddenly had a question and asked her.
“I understand that the shrine is the best place to test our courage, but is it open at night?”
“…It looks like it’s open. But you shouldn’t make any noise. Just enjoy the atmosphere.”
“Yeah, that’s right.”
Even though it’s open even at night, causing a disturbance was out of the question.
“…So, we should all go to the shrine.”
Kaede raised her hand when Yukine said that with an unusually rough snort.
“No, no! I don’t want to!”
“…Lie. Kaede seemed to like it even though she said she didn’t.”
“I’m not that weird.”
“It’s interesting, you know?”
“Ryo-kun?”
“I-I’m also a little interested!”
“Even Kaori?”
Kaede looked around as if she was looking for a friend, as if she didn’t expect that there would be so many people interested in a test of courage.
“T-that’s right! Shingo-kun? You don’t want to do the test of courage, right?”
“E-eeh? W-well… I’m sorry about that. I-I’m also a little interested in it…”
“N-no way…”
Kaede’s face turns pale in despair. She seemed to be in a state of shock.
“Yu-Yuuya-kun, how about you…?”
“Eh, I-I was… sorry, I’m not that bad at it, so…”
“Uuugghh. I don’t have any friends!”
Kaede groaned and got teary-eyed. I-I’m sorry for what I said.
Then, Rin laughed out loud at the sight of Kaede.
“Ahahahaha! Just give up, Kaede. Besides, the place we are going to is a shrine, you know? Isn’t it rather safe?”
“S-safe?”
“You see, a shrine is a place where gods reside, right? There won’t be any scary devils or ghosts there, you know?”
“I-I wonder if it’s…?”
“Right.”
Rin said this to persuade Kaede, but is it really true that a shrine is safe? Although it is open at night, a shrine is like a home for the gods, right? Even humans would not like it if people came into their homes without permission in the middle of the night. I feel it would be somewhat wrong… But if that is the case, wouldn’t it be a nuisance to make a New Year’s Eve visit to the shrine?
Kaede was about to be persuaded by Rin’s words, but then she noticed something and shook her head.
“Ha! B-but if I don’t go, I’d be safe to begin with!”
“Tsk…”
“Rin-chan, why did you click your tongue?”
“Geez,… then, do you want to stay here?”
“Huh?”
When Rin’s unexpected words surprised not only Kaede but also us, Rin grinned.
“We’ll simply go to the shrine to test our courage. If you’re scared, you can wait for us here, Kaede. But you’ll be alone in this cottage, you know?”
“Hyii!”
Kaede shrieked at Rin’s smile. Rin-san, you have said a terrible thing…
Then, Kaede shivered with tears in her eyes and finally screamed.
“Ri-Rin-chan, you’re a demoooonnn!”
“Ahahahahahahaha!”
──Thus, Kaede will also participate in the test of courage.
  ＊＊＊
  “A-Are you okay?”
“I-I-I-I’m fine!?”
“…It doesn’t sound like it, but…”
As we approached the shrine, Kaede seemed to get more and more scared and was now clinging to my arm. At first, I was very nervous about Kaede clinging to me, but the way she clung to my arm and how she looked at me made me more worried than nervous.
“Um… If you’re so scared, do you want to go back to the cottage?”
“Don’t leave me aloneeeeeee!”
“No, if you’re going back, I’ll stay with you…”
But Kaede didn’t seem to hear my words and kept walking while shaking her head. In the end, we’re going to go with everyone…
Then I noticed Kaori was watching Kaede and me.
“…..”
“Kaori? What’s wrong?”
“Huh? N-no, it’s nothing!”
“Really?”
If it’s nothing, then it’s probably nothing.
“Ugh… I should have been scared from the start too…”
With that thought in mind, I turned my attention to Kaede, who continued to struggle with her fears, and did not notice Kaori’s murmur.
“Yuuya. You are also a sinful man.”
“Huh?”
I tilted my head when Rin said that in a meaningful way. Sinful, huh… did I do something to offend anyone?
As we moved forward following Yukine, we stopped when she stopped.
“…This is our destination.”
“Wow. It’s huge.”
“Y-yeah. And it’s pretty mysterious…”
As Shingo-kun said, the shrine in front of us looked more mysterious than scary due to the fact that it was in the middle of a forest with the moonlight shining on the shrine.
The beauty of the place made us admire it for a while.
“I didn’t know there was a place like this nearby…”
“It’s a nice place, regardless of whether this is a test of courage or not. Kaede thinks so too, doesn’t she?”
“U-Un. It’s beautiful…”
The mystical sight of the shrine seemed to make Kaede forget her fears, even if this was only temporarily. And then Yukine, who was also admiring the shrine and the surrounding atmosphere, muttered.
“…It’s beautiful. But it wasn’t the right place for a test of courage.”
“Well, that’s okay. That’s how we got to see the beautiful scene──.”
It was the moment when Rin was about to say so.
“──I feel some mysterious presence.”
“!?”
Suddenly, a woman slowly appeared from the shrine.
The woman was dressed in a shrine maiden attire. Her glossy black hair was tied on both sides, and her bangs were neatly trimmed. Her eyes were lifted up, and she seemed to have a strong spirit.
She looked to be about the same age as us, but she seemed to have a holy aura about her.
When all of us were surprised by the shrine maiden’s sudden appearance, Kaede pointed at such a woman and exclaimed.
“Gggggggg…ggg-ghoooooooosssssttt!”
“Eeeeehhh!?”
“Where’s the ghost?”
The woman’s words were met with a look of disbelief. We came here to test our courage, so I can understand why Kaede might think she’s a ghost. But no matter how you look at it, she’s a shrine maiden of this shrine.
The shrine maiden let out a sigh and looked over at us.
“There’s something strange going on here, so I came over to… what? You don’t look like worshippers, are you?”
Yukine answered the shrine maiden’s questioning expression straightforwardly.
“…We came here to test our courage.”
“Test your courage? Eh, you’re…”
“…..? What is it?”
As soon as the shrine maiden gave Yukine a sharp look, she moved away from Yukine with an astonishing speed.
“! You’re possessed by something outrageous!”
“……? Something outrageous?”
“How could you not notice? Oh, geez! I’ll exorcise you right now!”
The shrine maiden then pulled out what looked like a talisman from out of nowhere.
“───.”
Then, chanting something in a voice we couldn’t hear, she threw the talisman at Yukine’s shadow!
    “What the hell are you───?”
“───Gu-gugyaa, gugiiiiii!”
“!?”
Then, Yukine’s shadow suddenly swelled, and a black mist appeared.
What the heck is this…? This is not a different world.
“Yu-Yuuya-san, what is that”
Kaori, who also knows about the different worlds, had her eyes wide open, not expecting to see such a monster on Earth.
Kaori and I were so surprised, but Kaede’s surprise was probably even greater.
“W-wha…”
“No way…?”
“Hyiiii!?”
“Yu-Yukine… Have you done something again?”
While Kaede and the others are pale and trembling, Yukine doesn’t seem to be too frightened. Is it a daily occurrence in the occult research club?
I looked at Yukine, but she kept a straight face and nodded quietly.
“…It surprised me.”
“Don’t you understand it?”
Rin immediately tsukomied her. I-I’m glad to hear that… I was wondering what I would do if someone told me that this was the norm…
With that in mind, the shrine maiden who threw the talisman that may have caused the monster to appear in front of her paled as she faced the monster.
“W-what on earth is this thing…!”
“Eh?”
“It is neither an evil spirit nor a youkai… I’ve never seen such an evil being!”
It seems that this monster was unexpected even for the shrine maiden. Then the black mist began to change its shape as it looked around. The creature now stood on two legs, its entire body heaving with muscles.
The claws and fangs were sharp, and the skin was black as if the shadows and darkness had become flesh.
…Eh? This is…
“Gugi… gugigiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!”
“What?”
“Kuh?”
“E-everyone!?”
The moment the monster screamed a cry that cut through the air, Kaori and the others fell to their knees.
I tried to pick up everyone in a hurry, but the monster threatened me, and I couldn’t move as I wanted. What the heck is this thing…!
Then, the shrine maiden, who was the only one to get down on one knee, looked up at me in pain, and opened her eyes.
“H-how can you… in this situation… still remain unaffected…! Or rather, there’s also a hint of wickedness in you too…!”
“W-what do you mean by that… I don’t know what…!”
“Gugigigigi…”
For me, it was as if everyone had suddenly collapsed due to the screaming of the monster in front of me. There was nothing wrong with my body.
The monster seemed to be even more alarmed by the fact that I was not affected in any way. While I was confused by the situation, Kuro, who had been quietly sitting inside me all this time, called out to me with a big sigh.
“Fuwahh… There was a strange presence, so I came to check it out… Why is this guy here? Hey, Yuuya. This is the place called Earth, right?”
“Yes, but… Eh, Kuro! Do you know what this monster is?”
“I know what it is; it is an existence… that has failed to become an Evil.”
“So, it’s an evil beast?”
When I listened back to the unfamiliar words I couldn’t help but ask, the shrine maiden who was moaning in pain looked at me with a doubtful expression.
“? Y-you… who the heck are you talking to…!”
“Eh!? Oh, that…”
“…You’re so careless, aren’t you? Oh well. Listen to me without talking. The evil beast in front of you is not a good thing either for you or for this world. I don’t know why it’s in this place at all, but… first of all, if you leave it alone, there will be some serious problems.” said Kuro.
Even if you say that it will cause a lot of trouble…!
The evil beast is so strong that it’s called the evil incarnation. Night and the others are not here right now… Will I be able to handle this on my own?
As I was feeling uneasy, the evil beast, which has been on guard for a long time, attacked me as if it had lost its nerves.
“Gugigigigi… Gugigigyaaa!”
“Ugh? T-that’s dangerous!”
“Gugiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!”
“Uh?”
The shrine maiden tried to take out some kind of talisman again, probably to protect me from being attacked, but she couldn’t move her body enough and ended up losing the talisman from her hand.
I considered hurrying to avoid it, but I couldn’t because Kaede and the others were just behind me.
Then, my body, which naturally moved to fight back due to my training with Master Usagi, kicked the evil beast on the side of the head while half dodging its attack.
“Gugii?”
The evil beast took my kick and was blown away, hitting a nearby tree and slipping down.
“Gu-gugii…”
“I thought it was a decent kick, but you’re still standing, huh…?”
Even though I kicked it with all my might, the evil beast was still alive as it tried to stand up, though it looked like it was in pain. Although not completely, it still has the power of evil and is probably quite strong.
“If that’s the case…!”
At the moment when the evil beast hurriedly tried to retake its stance, the shrine maiden unexpectedly jumped out. She released a talisman at the evil beast.
“Get out of here!”
“Gugyiigugyaa!?”
When the talisman touched the evil beast, it began to suffer. Then, it desperately tried to remove the talisman but was unable to do so. Finally it disappeared in a cloud of smoke.
T-that talisman is… or rather, who the heck is this shrine maiden?
“More importantly, how is Kaori and the others!”
I rushed over to Kaori and the others to check on their condition. Then, it seems that all of them are just asleep, which is a relief.
“Thank goodness…”
“──Hey, you.”
“Huh?”
When I turned my gaze towards the voice, I saw a languid-looking shrine maiden glaring at me.
“Why were you the only one who was safe? And can you explain to me the power… that overwhelmed the monster earlier?”
“Um…”
I was at a loss for an answer, not knowing what to say.

Chapter 4 – Wriggling Malice
Part 1
  I was able to get permission for Kaori and the others who were still asleep to rest at the shrine, so I took advantage of the hospitality and carried everyone to bed.
“───So? What was that all about earlier?”
After putting everyone to bed, I was interrogated by the shrine maiden like that.
“Um… I don’t even know what that thing was either…”
“You’re lying. You must have something to do with it, right? Otherwise, it wouldn’t explain your power to defeat the monster earlier.”
“Even if you say so…”
When asked if that has anything to do with me, it seems that the monster is an “evil beast” that is a corruption of the “evil” from the other world, so I can’t say that it has nothing to do with me. However, I have no idea why such a being appeared on this Earth.
For a moment, I thought that the door to the other world in my house might be the reason why it came out of there. Still, it would have to break through the mysterious barrier covering Sage-san’s house in the other world. More importantly, Night and Ouma-san would have noticed it… though Ouma-san would likely have left it alone.
With that in mind, the shrine maiden, who once again wore a serious expression, opened her mouth.
“I don’t know exactly what, but there is a presence of evil in you, too. So, I will exorcise it.”
“Eh?”
The sudden offer made me shout in a distracted voice.
“Do you mind? I don’t know if you’re aware of it or not, but I can feel the same evil presence in you as in that monster. So if I don’t exorcise it right now, you’ll be in trouble again.”
“Eh, no, that’s…”
“Hey, is this woman trying to make me disappear?” said Kuro.
The shrine maiden’s words made Kuro, who was inside me, panicked. Certainly, the evil beast was extinguished with that talisman, and it may be effective for Kuro as well.
“Um, It’s not like I’m───.”
“It’s okay! For now, take off your clothes for the exorcism.”
“Why?”
I opened my eyes to the shrine maiden’s sudden request. Eh, taking off my clothes?
I was confused, but the shrine maiden frowned unhappily.
“Can I? In order to exorcise that evil presence, we need to borrow power from the holy air that floats around the world. So, the more skin you expose, the easier it is for the holy spirit to enter. That’s why I’m telling you to take off your clothes because they’re in the way.”
“Eeeeeehhh?”
“Yuuya! You should never take off your clothes!” said Kuro in a hurry.
“No, I’m not taking my clothes off!”
“Why not? I said, take them off!”
The shrine maiden finally took a hard line and tried to pull my clothes off! I know she’s trying to be nice, but I don’t want Kuro to be exorcised, and I don’t want to take off my clothes either.
I’m stronger than her, but if I resist with all my might, I might injure the shrine maiden, and more importantly, my clothes will tear.
W-what should I do with this?
“Oh, geez! Stop your useless resistance!”
“N-nooooo! Help meeeee!”
“…Yuuya-san, what is going on here?”
“”Huh!””
When we were startled by the unexpected voice, Kaori was glaring at us with fierce eyes.
“Yuuya-san… who is that woman over there? And why is it that Yuuya-san is undressed…?”
Kaori was about to say that much, but she seemed to recognize my current appearance once again, and her face gradually turned red.
“Ka-Kaori! It’s a misunderstanding; it’s a misunderstanding!”
“T-that’s right! It’s not like I’m doing anything wrong…!”
The shrine maiden and I rushed to clear up Kaori’s misunderstanding. Then Kaori, who managed to regain her calm after resolving the misunderstanding, looked around again.
“By the way… where are we? We were supposed to have come to test our courage…”
In response to Kaori’s reaction, I couldn’t help but look at the shrine maiden, who also had a puzzled expression on her face. No way, does she have no memory of meeting that evil beast?
Then after Kaori, Kaede, Rin, and the others woke up, and everyone was confirmed to be safe. However, none of them seemed to remember anything about the evil beast.
Seeing the reaction of Kaori and the others, the shrine maiden quietly approached me.
“…It seems that everyone doesn’t remember anything about that.”
“Y-you’re right.”
“Phew… I would really like to ask them some questions, but they don’t seem to know much about that monster either, so there’s no need to tell the rest about it. I’m worried about what it might do to their body later, but I’ve never seen anything like it before, and there’s nothing I can do about it. Well, I’ve been attacked in the same way, and there’s nothing physically wrong with me, so I think everything will be fine…”
Certainly, considering the fact that everyone suddenly fainted, it would be better to think of some kind of effect.
For the time being, I checked the condition of everyone with the [Identification] skill, but I didn’t see anything strange.
“It’s okay. Anyway, if you learn anything from this, don’t try to test your courage again; just leave quietly.”
That’s all the shrine maiden said as she turned to leave.
“W-wait, please!”
“…What?”
When I hastily stopped her, she looked at me with a slightly unhappy expression. But, undaunted by such a gaze, I opened my mouth.
“Um, I’m sorry about this… And thank you for letting Kaori and the others rest here.”
“…I don’t mind, that’s about right. But next time, you should be a little more careful.”
“Yes… we’ll be careful.”
As we were about to leave, the shrine maiden unexpectedly called out to us.
“You!”
“Huh? I-is it me?”
“Yes.”
The shrine maiden looked at me closely and asked quietly.
“…What’s your name?”
“Eh? Oh, I’m Yuuya Tenjou.”
“Fumu… Tenjou, right?”
As the shrine maiden muttered that to confirm, I couldn’t help but ask her.
“Um, and you are…?”
“…Mai Kagurazaka.”
Shrine maiden-san, or… Kagurazaka-san said and turned her back on us once again.
And then…
“I have a feeling I’ll be seeing you again at some point.”
“Huh?”
“Well then.”
That was all Kagurazaka-san said, and this time she left. After that, we went back to the cottage quietly and went to bed immediately.
  ＊＊＊
  The next day, we made it back to our hometown safely.
“Well, the beach was fun!”
“Y-yeah. It was fun to play with everyone.”
“Though we were a bit confused when we were suddenly asked to help Sawada-sensei’s family!”
“That’s true. I was more surprised about meeting Sawada-sensei at the beach.”
“…She was boing boing.”
“Yu-Yukine-chan?”
Rin murmurs with a wry smile as she recalls her memories of the beach.
“Even so… the fun time flies by so fast.”
“That’s right… I had a lot of fun playing with you guys too! Thank you very much!”
“That should be our line, you know!”
“Yeah. Thanks to Houjou-san, we were able to play with all our might like this.”
“R-really? If you say so, it’s worth inviting everyone!”
“But now that the beach is over, the summer vacation will continue for a while. Can we go out again somewhere?”
When I suddenly suggested this, Kaede’s eyes lit up.
“That’s good, let’s play, let’s play! I’ve already finished my summer homework, after all!”
“That’s because I took care of it for you.”
“Thank you very much for the help, hehe…”
“…So, what’s next, a summer festival?”
“Oh, a festival! That sounds great.”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah! Then let’s have a festival next time!”
So, after promising to go to a summer festival, we parted ways this time.
Then I went straight home too…
“I’m home!”
“Woof!”
“You’re back, welcome home.”
“Buhi buhi!”
“Mmm? You finally returned. Now, prepare the food. I’m starving.”
Night and the others greeted me.
…In the past, it would have been hard to imagine. Playing with friends and having someone welcome you home like this.
While enjoying such happiness, I prepared food for Night and the others. But as I prepared the food for them, I kept thinking about something.
What is that monster… the evil beast? I’ve heard that it’s an incarnation of evil…
What’s more, how can it cross into this world?
I asked Ouma-san about something that had been bothering me.
“Um, Ooma-san…”
“What is it? I’m hungry now. Go ahead and make me some food! I want to eat curry!”
“Y-yes.”
I was going to ask him about the evil beast that had crossed into this world, but as I was busy preparing the meal, I missed the chance to ask him.

Part 2
  It was the next day after I came back from Kaori’s vacation house. The summer vacation is still going on, so today, I was thinking of cleaning up my grandpa’s warehouse, which I hadn’t done recently.
Then, Ouma-san, Yuti, and others came to see me, as if they were interested in my grandpa’s warehouse.
“Hmm… I’ve always thought this place had a strange vibe, but looking at it again, I can feel it more strongly.”
“Affirmative. It’s strange.”
“I-is that so?”
There are indeed many things in this room that grandpa acquired during his travels, all of which are of unknown use, but…
As I contemplated and tilted my head, Ouma-san let out a sigh of exasperation.
“Yuuya… you’re in a room with all this power swirling around you, and you don’t feel a thing?”
“Huh?”
“It’s not just one kind of power. Every single one of them has a power that I do not know. Who is this… grandfather of yours anyway?”
“W-well…”
There are things that even Ouma-san doesn’t understand… Grandpa, what did you really have collected?
I was going to clean it up now, but I’m getting a little afraid to touch it. However, if I don’t do it, it won’t be finished anytime soon, so I start to sort it out.
Ouma-san looked interested in the beginning, but he eventually got bored halfway through and went back to another room in the Earth house. Yuti also said she was going to practice archery and headed to the garden of Sage-san’s house in the other world.
…Well, I was going to do it alone from the beginning, so that was fine.
While sorting it out little by little, I also activated my [Identification] skill while I was at it…
“…Really, grandpa, where did you get these from?”
Some things, even with the [Identification] skill, I couldn’t even tell the name of the item, let alone its effect.
For example, I don’t know what the principle of this thing is, but I can’t tell the name, the effect, nor the material of this cubic stone (?) floating on a pedestal. No, really, why is it floating? It’s not like it’s magnetic…
As I continued to sort through the items while activating [Identification] skill, I suddenly found something familiar.
“Huh? This looks like something… a monk would carry, doesn’t it?”
It was something called Khakkhara, and in my mind, it was a thing that a monk would carry. I’m not particularly surprised that such a thing would come out of nowhere in a world overflowing with things whose purpose is unknown, but it does make me curious.
I thought that the [Identification] skill would not work on this one either, but this time it did.
However…
“[Heavenly Khakkhara], huh… It’s somewhat quite a bit of a thing, but… what is it? This “Exorcise” is…”
What’s more, there was only one word of effect written on it. I can’t understand anything about this.
“What is it? This is… This is similar to the talisman that Kagurazaka-san was using the other day?”
The other day, when an evil beast attacked me, I suddenly remembered that Kagurazaka-san, the shrine maiden I had met there, had used a talisman to kill the evil beast. I wondered if that was also a kind of exorcism?
An item I don’t understand? Is it a weapon? As I was bewildered in front of the unfamiliar item or weapon, I noticed…
“Woof… woof!”
“What’s wrong? Night.”
Suddenly, Night barked, and as I wondered what was wrong, I felt the presence of several people following Night.
“? What is it?”
I paused for a moment and put the Khakkhara I had in my hand in the item box, then headed for the garden of the other world house.
There, I found Owen-san, Lexia-san, and the others. All of them walked quickly into Sage-san’s garden.
“Hah… hah…”
“We managed to get here somehow…”
“H-hey. We’ve set foot in this Great Devil’s Nest many times already, but I still wonder how we’ve survived…”
“In any case, it’s thanks to that person, followed by Captain Owen, and Luna, who was appointed as Lexia-sama’s bodyguard, is also quite strong…
“Rather, except for that person and the two of them, we do not have the ability to enter the Great Devil’s Nest properly…”
The soldiers already have wounds on their bodies, and Owen-san and Luna are also out of breath. Although I looked around to see if anyone was hurt, fortunately, no one was fully injured, and I didn’t need Akatsuki to lend me a hand.
I don’t know why Lexia-san and the others came to this place, but I think they had something to do with me, so I told Night and the others to rest at the Earth house for the time being. But I wondered who was “that person” the soldiers were talking about earlier.
In the midst of all this, Lexia-san, the only one in good spirits, spotted me, and her eyes sparkled.
“Yuuya-sama! I came to see you! Wait… Who is that girl?”
“Huh?”
“?”
Yuti, who Lexia-san pointed out, tilted her head in wonder. Luna also nodded several times as she caught her breath at the sight of Lexia-san.
Speaking of which, when capturing the first prince of Alceria, Rhaegar-sama, I mentioned that we were attacked, but I didn’t tell Lexia-san or Luna who the attacker was…
Even so, I had already explained this to Owen-san and Arnold-sama when we were discussing Ouma-san’s case the other day.
Owen-san already knows about it, so when I explained to Lexia-san straightforwardly, including the introduction of Yuti, Lexia-san and others were troubled in their minds.
“Such a girl is a member of the Dark Guild that conspired with my brother… Are there only girls in the Dark Guild?”
“N-no, not really… but I’ve never seen this girl before either. And I’m also surprised that she’s a disciple of the Bow Saint…”
“Certainly… I thought that the “Holy” was only in fairy tales…”
In response to their reaction, Yuti tilted her head even more and said something outrageous.
“? Unknown. I’m not involved with the Dark Guild anymore.”
“Huh?”
That seemed to be the first time Owen-san had heard of it, and everyone rolled their eyes.
B-by the way, Lexia-san’s words reminded me of the fact that Yuti is related to the Dark Guild…
More than that, the information that he is a disciple of the “Bow Saint” is more significant.
“Before. I tried to kill the people who killed my master. But it was the work of the Evil. So now I have no reason to kill humans. …I still hate them, but I won’t take that feeling out on people who aren’t related to me anymore.”
It seemed that Yuti had made up her mind about other humans in her own way, and unlike when she first attacked me, now she no longer thought of any human being as an enemy.
This was probably due in large part to Kaori and the friends she had made at the school on Earth. It really was a good thing that I transferred Yuti to my school.
“Conclusion. That’s why I’m not in contact with the Dark Guild anymore. There’s no need for it.”
“Y-you mean you don’t need them? What was your role in the Dark Guild anyway?”
“A bouncer?”
“I don’t know why you made that as a question… but the Dark Guild even hired bouncers, huh? You’re not a member of the guild like me, but you probably have connections with the upper echelons. No wonder I never see you…”
“Affirmative. I used to see him all the time; he seemed like a great guy.”
Owen-san, who was listening to Yuti, is pondering with a grim expression.
“In other words, there is no one in the Dark Guild that is as good as Yuti… At the time, it was right after I found out that Yuti was a member of the Dark Guild, so I thought it would be very difficult to get rid of the Dark Guild… This is something that I will have to tell His Majesty as soon as I get back to the royal capital.”
“By the way, what brings you all here? I believe the road was dangerous…”
According to Owen-san and the others, the place where this house is located is called the “Great Devil’s Nest,” and the people of this world rarely go near it, and it is not a place where you can come and go very easily.
However, Owen-san and the others had come to such a place many times just to meet me. There’s no convenient item like a telephone, and there’s no magic, so there’s no way to contact me either. …No, even if there were a phone, it wouldn’t have been in my house.
“Oh, about that───.”
(───I protected them, you know.)
“Eh, Master Usagi?”
Apparently, Master Usagi was the one who escorted them to this house. Was it Master Usagi that the soldier was talking about earlier?
“What exactly happened?”
(What? As usual, I was on my way here to train you when I saw a rare human figure, which was unusual. And since they were struggling at the entrance to the Great Devil’s Nest, and it seemed they wanted to see you, so I brought them along.)
“I-I see…?”
It’s true that if Master Usagi had been escorting them, they would have been safe…
However, the soldiers were strangely tired of that, so I couldn’t help but turn my attention to them.
“I-it’s too strict… and more than double the usual training…”
“Being forced to go one-on-one with a goblin elite… What kind of nightmare is that?”
“If we try to escape, we’ll get one hell of a kick in the ass…”
“Yeah… It’s good that we’re still alive…!”
“…Master Usagi?”
(What? I’m just giving them a little workout, that’s all.)
“…Is this normal in the Great Devil’s Nest?”
“He’s a rabbit, and he’s strong, I don’t get it at all…”
“And he’s speaking normal human language…?”
Apparently, Owen-san and the others were tired because Master Usagi had trained them, and the soldiers were pale in the face. T-thank you for your hard work…
Owen-san coughed one to change the atmosphere.
“Ahem! By the way, the reason we came here today is───.”
“Oh, that’s right! Yuuya-sama, let’s go to the festival together!”

Part 3
  “Oh, that’s right! Yuuya-sama, let’s go to the festival together!”
“Huh?”
“…Lexia. That’s too much to say, no matter what.”
When I raised my voice dumbly at Lexia-san’s sudden words, she went on with a sparkle in her eyes.
“It’s fine! This girl… uh, Yuti, was it?”
“Affirmative.”
“I have a lot of questions I want to ask Yuuya-sama about Yuti, but! But it’s more important that you go to the festival with me!
“No, that doesn’t explain anything…”
Luna said tiredly at Lexia-san’s state and then told me with a serious expression.
“The fact is, the Regal Kingdom, which has friendly relations with the Alceria Kingdom, is holding a national festival to celebrate its centennial. And Lexia is inviting you.”
“Huh… Well, it’s hard to say without checking my schedule…”
“And by the way, you can’t say no to that.”
“Why?”
It would indeed be difficult to refuse the request of the princess, Lexia-san, but…? It’s not that it’s difficult; it’s that it’s impossible because of my status. I’m a commoner, you know.
Despite my surprise, Owen-san explained it to me while holding his head.
“Ah… Well, I am very sorry. Lexia-sama’s behavior has caused the Regal Kingdom to take an interest in Yuuya-dono.”
“Yes? W-why me? What can I say? I’m just an ordinary person──.”
“””That’s not true.”””
“You don’t have to deny it all at once like that…”
“Yuuya. Lexia and I just learned about it in the Regal Kingdom. I heard that… you tamed a legendary dragon, didn’t you?”
“Oh, you mean Ouma-san? It’s not that I tamed him; it’s that it was a coincidence…”
“You should have realized something was wrong at that point.”
“S-surely…!”
No, I’d completely lost my senses! I’m starting to forget that Ouma-san is a legendary dragon.
After all, he’s either sleeping or eating all day long. When he first came to Earth, he was interested in my textbooks and books about Earth, but he seems to have gotten bored with them.
I need to buy a TV so that he won’t be bored anymore. I’m really sorry that he can’t go around the Earth freely…
“Sigh… Anyway, the Regal Kingdom has taken an interest in you. The king of Regal is very interested in you, and we made a promise to him.”
“Eh? What promise?”
“The king wanted you to participate in a tournament in front of the people at the founding festival.”
“What about my will?”
A tournament, you say? It’s that, right? It’s where martial artists show off their skills in front of important people. And they will fight each other, right?
…Why am I involved in such a situation?
Lexia-san averted her gaze somewhat awkwardly at the dumbfounded me.
“U-um… The king of that country said that Yuuya-sama is weaker than the Sword Saint…”
“Huh?”
(Little girl. Did you just say Sword Saint?)
Master Usagi, who until then seemed uninterested, reacted to Lexia-san’s words and asked with a slightly surprised look.
However, Lexia-san seemed to be more bothered by Master Usagi’s words than that.
“W-who are you call little girl? In the first place, who are you? You’re a bit stronger than Owen and the others, and just because you can speak human language, don’t get carried away!”
(What is it, Yuuya? Didn’t you tell these people about me?)
“Eh? Ah… if you ask me that… or rather, why Master Usagi didn’t tell them your name himself?”
(I did name myself. It’s Usagi.)
“Can that be called a name…?”
When Master Usagi said that, I tilted my head. W-well, he’s telling the truth, but he’s not teaching them anything important like he’s a Kicking Saint or anything like that.
“…So, thinking about it again, we were being protected without really knowing this person. Since the rabbit suddenly spoke to us and had a power that we could not match, we were forced to follow him quietly…”
Owen-san also muttered in astonishment. Master Usagi can be very forceful. It can’t be helped.
I awkwardly introduced Master Usagi.
“Um… this is my master, Master Usagi. He is the holder of the titles of Kicking Saint and Ear Saint.”
“Eh?”
“What? T-this person?”
“Yuuya, how much more do you want to surprise us…?”
When Lexia and the others found out that Master Usagi was a Holy, their eyes widened, and they froze. According to Owen-san’s story, just like Ouma-san, Holy is existence in fairy tales that is beyond admiration…
When I was thinking about that, Master Usagi tilted his head in wonder.
(What, you haven’t fully introduced me yet.)
“Eh? What else do I have to introduce…?”
(It’s true that I’m teaching Yuuya the art of fighting, but at the same time, I’m also learning magic from Yuuya. In other words, we are both master and apprentice, are we not?)
“Ah…”
“Eeeeehhhhhh”
“Empathy. I agree. Yuuya is quite crazy.”
It’s not only Lexia-san and the others, but even the soldiers who were listening in the back were startled out loud by Master Usagi’s words.
“N-no, I can understand being a disciple of the Holy, but…”
“Hey, hey, you don’t know what a disciple of the Holy means, do you?”
“A disciple and master of the Holy, the master of the legendary dragon… who the hell exactly is this… Yuuya-dono…?”
I feel that various things are being mentioned about me, but all of them are force majeure!
Master Usagi rescued me when I was in a pinch, and I owe him a debt of gratitude, but it wasn’t long before I became his disciple and then his master. I have so many things to say, but Master Usagi’s words completely misunderstood me as an extraordinary person.
Not caring about my feelings, Master Usagi smiled fearlessly at Lexia-san.
(So, that’s why. Do you understand now? Little girl.)
“U-ugh…”
As expected, when she’s dealing with Master Usagi, she has to admit that she’s been called a little girl. In fact, I don’t know how long Master Usagi has been alive, but he’s the best aside from Ouma-san…
Then Master Usagi’s smile disappeared, and his expression became serious, and he looked at Lexia-san again.
(Now, enough with the teasing. I’ll ask you one more time, is there really the Sword Saint in the Regal Kingdom?)
“Y-yes. That’s what the king over there said. Then, the king heard about Yuuya-sama’s greatness and said that the Sword Saint was greater than Yuuya-sama! So I denied it, and before I knew it…”
Lexia-san’s end of the sentence gradually disappeared. She was really taken for a ride by the king of the Regal Kingdom…
But this is all there is to it.
I don’t know why Lexia-san thought that I was stronger than the Sword Saint, but the Sword Saint is the same as Master Usagi, right? I can’t even beat Yuti, who was only a disciple, so how could I possibly compete with the Sword Saint?
“Um, I am sorry. This is only a preliminary match, right? So I will──.”
(You should participate.)
“Eh?
I couldn’t help but stare at Master Usagi. Um… Master Usagi? What did you just say?
I broke out in a cold sweat and asked him again, thinking he was just kidding.
“Um… what did you say?”
(Didn’t you hear me? I told you to participate. You can’t refuse it. It’s master’s order.)
“Isn’t that too arrogant?”
I couldn’t help but exclaim when he said that to me. However, Master Usagi crossed his arms and smirked.
(If there really is the Sword Saint in that country, it’s convenient for me as well. I also need to consult with her about the Evil. But more than that, it’s perfect for your training.)
“Eh?”
(I can teach you how to kick, but I can’t teach you how to use a sword. Your fighting style is a mixture of hand-to-hand fighting and a variety of weapons such as swords and spears. So you need to learn to use a sword, right?)
“That’s, well…”
As Master Usagi said, if anything, I mainly fight using the weapons left behind by Sage-san, such as the [Omni-Sword] and the [Absolute Spear]. Of course, I also do some fighting, including kicking, which I learned from Master Usagi.
At my slurred speech, Master Usagi gave me a serious look.
(No matter what you think, Evil will no longer let you go. I feel bad that I got you involved in the battle with the Evil, as you are not officially the heir to the Holy. But there’s nothing I can do about it. That’s why it’s my mission to train you so that you can survive as long as possible.)
“Master Usagi…”
As I thought during the attack on Yuti, I really don’t have enough power to live safely in this world.
…I still regret that when the Fist Saint attacked Master Usagi, I couldn’t move properly with my own strength.
According to Master Usagi and Yuti, the power of Kuro… the Evil inside of me could have defeated him, but the reality is that I couldn’t even handle it properly. If I were to become a danger not only to Master Usagi, Yuti, Night, and the others but also to Kaori and the others on Earth, I would never be able to forgive myself.
So I have no choice but to get the power so that I can stay safe in this world without relying on Evil’s power.
“…Are they talking about something outrageous?”
“Let’s pretend we didn’t hear that.”
Then, behind me, Lexia-san and the others talked about something, but I didn’t pay attention to them now, and finally, I nodded once.
“…I understand. Fortunately, I have some time now, and I don’t know how far this will go, but I will accept it.”
“R-really? That’s great! Right, Luna?”
“Y-yeah. But are you sure you want to do this?”
“Yes. But, as I said, I’m not as good as Lexia-san expects me to be, so if you can take that with a grain of salt…”
When I said that confidently, Master Usagi smiled ferociously.
(Then, I will continue to train you so that you can compete with the Sword Saint at least a little.)
“Eh?”
(Little girl. When is this national festival?)
“Huh? Oh, let’s see… It’s in a week, but…”
(A week… It’s so short, but I’ll make you better than now. Are you ready for that?)
“Yeah…”
I was trembling with fear, wondering what kind of hellish training awaited me in the week leading up to the national festival.
  ＊＊＊
  ───While Yuuya was receiving training from Master Usagi in preparation for his match against the Sword Saint, the young boy Evil and the two Fallen Saints were talking in the Orz Forest in Regal Country.
“Aah~, I can’t wait to go on a rampage! I want to mess up the Sword Saint and hear her scream!”
“Gugyaaaaaaa!?”
“Guruooooooo!”
The boy with the shining eyes, Evil, was taking out his stress of not being able to attack the Regal Country in front of him on the monsters around him.
All of them were A-class or S-class monsters, and they were not the kind that could be easily defeated.
However, to the boy’s Evil, there was no difference in the monsters’ existence, and he recognized them all as equally weak.
“Hey, hey, hey! You have to help me pass the time!”
“G-gaaaaah!”
“G-gugee…”
As soon as a black mist seemed to erupt from the boy’s Evil body, it turned into countless sharp blades that pierced the monster’s body or sliced through its flesh.
Because the monsters were classified as A-class or S-class, their defenses were not ordinary. Still, the boy’s Evil attacks easily penetrated the monsters’ defenses and reaped their lives.
The corpses of some of the monsters had already been killed and were being cut up for comfort, and before the boy knew it, a pile of monster corpses had formed around him, and the smell of blood filled the air around him.
Then, while the boy’s Evil was killing and playing with the monsters, the Fallen Spear Saint called out to the boy’s Evil.
“───Can I have your attention for a moment, sir?”
“Hmm~? What’s the matter?”
“I’ve heard that when I went to check on the situation in the Regal Kingdom a while ago… it seems that the Sword Saint is also thinning out the monsters in this forest.”
“Huh~! Is that so?”
“So, if you move too flamboyantly, there is a risk that our movements will be detected───.”
It was the spear’s Fallen Saint who almost said that much, but he couldn’t come up with the next word. Suddenly, the overwhelming killing intent that came from the boy’s Evil made his body unable to move.
“Hey, why are you the one telling me what to do?”
“I-a… a… ugh…”
Although he desperately tried to move his mouth to say something, the spear’s Fallen Saint was unable to speak.
Originally, if Holy is against the Evil, not only will their status be fully released, but they will be able to fight Evil with double stats. However, even if the two of them were to attack the boy in front of him, he was sure that neither of them would be able to inflict a single scratch on him.
This is the reason why he descended on the Evil as the Fallen Saint because there was such a difference in their abilities, and they had made it clear.
Not only the spear’s Fallen Saint but also the scythe’s Fallen Saint are stiffened by the killing intent emitted by the boy’s Evil.
“It looked like you’re getting carried away, but you’re just pawns for us. You are a slave. Do you understand?”
“…..”
“A slave expressing their opinion to their master is just… disgusting.”
As the boy’s Evil waved his arm irritably, a jet-black surge shot out from his arm, wiping out a large portion of the Orz Forest.
A huge crater was created there.
Suddenly, the boy’s Evil softened the atmosphere as The Fallen Saints’ bodies stiffened more and more from the sheer magnitude.
“…Well, I don’t care if the Sword Saint finds me here and we fight, but that wouldn’t be much fun, would it? I’ve done it again, but as you said, I’ll be quiet from now on. As for me, I want to hear the best screams in the most fun scenes!”
The boy’s Evil smiled innocently and thought about the upcoming national festival.
──Thus, a variety of thoughts were converging on the Regal Kingdom.

Chapter 5 – A Match In A Present Of A King
Part 1
  “This is the Regal Kingdom!”
“Oh!”
“It’s lively.”
“Woof!”
“Fugo~.”
“Hmm, it’s noisy.”
A week later, I met up with Lexia-san and the others who had come to pick me up again at the entrance of the Great Devil’s Nest, and we now arrived at the Regal Kingdom, which was in a festive mood for its 100th anniversary.
In this trip, the distance was not as short as the one to the royal capital of the Alceria Kingdom, which could be reached in a day. We had to camp and pass through several villages along the way… That alone was a rare experience and was very refreshing.
Of course, I could get home with teleport magic instead of camping out, but it’s very dangerous for anyone aside from Lexia-san and Luna to find out about my teleportation magic, so I camped out like everyone else and made it safely into the Regal Kingdom.
The city was still as lively as the Alceria Kingdom, but the atmosphere was very different. The biggest difference would be the large number of people in robes – there was a large number of people doing business using magic.
For example, there were people who used magic for street performances… such as manipulating many fireballs at once, or people who were shopping and their purchases were floating in the air carried by some kind of membrane of wind. I got the impression that magic was used a lot in daily life.
When I asked Lexia-san, she explained to me that magic research was overwhelmingly active in the Regal Kingdom compared to other countries, which was apparent from the city. That makes sense.
By the way, when I toured the Alceria Kingdom with Lexia-san and the others before, she was dressed inconspicuously to hide from the public, but now she was properly dressed in luxurious clothes fitting of a princess. The people in town looked at her from a distance, but they didn’t call out to her, nor did they give her an unnecessarily welcoming mood. Perhaps, they don’t realize that she was the princess of the Alceria Kingdom.
I don’t know for sure, but unless you go out officially, is this how people in town react? I’m grateful for that now.
“So many people.”
“Woof.”
“Fugo.”
“Hmm… noisy.”
As I looked around unconsciously at my surroundings, Lexia-san asked me in wonder.
“Speaking of which, where is your master, Yuuya-sama?”
“Eh? Oh, that reminds me…”
“He said he was going to see the Sword Saint.”
Ouma-san said this while staring depressingly at the crowd. Then, seeing the situation, Lexia-san and Luna twitched their cheeks.
“T-thinking about it again, it’s hard to believe that… this little dragon is the legendary dragon…”
“Items that allow you to change the size of your body are extremely rare on their own, but using it on a legendary dragon is even more so…”
When they came to tell me about today’s match in the Regal Kingdom, Lexia-san and the others did not meet Ouma-san, so just before we headed for this country, they met him for the first time. When they looked at the small Ouma-san, it seemed that they couldn’t believe that he was the legendary dragon, so there was a bit of an argument right before we left, which ended with Ouma-san getting annoyed and tried to enlarge himself.
Anyway, according to Ouma-san’s story, Master Usagi seems to have left to meet the Sword Saint first… but is it possible to meet the Sword Saint without being guided by anyone? Or perhaps, since they are both Holy, they can recognize each other when they are nearby?
As I was thinking about that, Lexia-san suddenly held me by the arm.
“Le-Lexia-san!?”
“More importantly, since we’ve come all this way, let’s take a look around the royal capital!”
“I-it’s okay, but your… chest is…”
“I hit it!”
“You hit it!?”
I didn’t think it would be said so openly by such a dignified person, so I just retort on it.
Then, Luna rebuked Lexia-san for that.
“Hey, Lexia. You’re a princess, aren’t you? Don’t be so loose──.”
“Ara, I’m a woman before I’m a princess, you know? Or maybe, Luna, are you jealous of me?”
“Ugh!”
Luna groaned, her face reddening at Lexia-san’s words.
“T-there’s no way that could be!”
“Then you should just be quiet. I’m going to have a great time touring the festival with Yuuya-sama! You should just escort us from behind.”
“Gugugugu…!”
“Uhm, Lexia-san? And Luna too…”
“Yuuya!”
“Y-yes?”
When Luna suddenly called out, I straightened my back and replied, and Luna quickly took my arm on the opposite side of Lexia-san’s!
“Lu-Luna-san?”
“I-I’ll go around the festival with Yuuya too!”
“What? What about the escort?”
“Lexia. I’m a woman too before I’m a guard, you know?”
“Ugh…!”
    For some reason, Luna had a triumphant expression on her face. In contrast, Lexia-san showed a frustrated expression.
Um… my thoughts were completely stopped by the unbelievable situation of having both of my arms grabbed by the girls.
Lexia-san was the one who asked me to marry her, and Luna was the one who gave me… um… a kiss. It would be impossible not to be concerned about it.
“First of all, there are not only Yuuya here, but also the legendary dragon, Yuti, Night and Akatsuki. What safer place could there be?”
“T-that’s…”
It was true that there’s no safer place than here with Ouma-san and the others present. I don’t know if Ouma-san would be willing to protect us though. This is probably why Owen-san and the other soldiers were escorting from a little distance away.
“Now, Yuuya. Let’s take a look around here.”
“Ah, wait! Yuuya-sama, let’s go over here!”
“Whoaa!”
I was pulled by both arms and led around by Lexia-san and Luna.
Looking at me like that, Ouma-san muttered in a dumbfounded manner.
“…Unexpectedly, his greatest enemy may not be the Evil, but women.”
“? Question. Then how could he beat me?”
“Hmm. It’s not about biological things like that… Even the sage was not good with this kind of situation. He also had a hard time with women. When I think about it, he and Yuuya are looking more and more alike…”
I had no way of knowing that such a conversation was taking place behind me.
  ＊＊＊
  “A match in front of a king, huh…”
In a distinguished guest room in the Regal Kingdom, the Sword Saint Iris was resting with a sigh. The work of thinning out the monsters in the Orz Forest was over, and now the king, Orghis, had requested for her to take a rest in preparation for the match.
“Why should I participate in the match… But maybe I can meet a man who is stronger than me?”
As a condition of her marriage, Iris was looking for a man who was stronger than her. Her eyes lit up but soon a gloomy expression returned.
“…No, it’s a vain hope. I’ve been looking all over for a man, and I’ve never met one, it’s not going to be this easy to find one. Sigh…”
(──Hmm. It’s rare to see the Sword Saint sighing.)
“! Usagi?”
When Iris was suddenly called to, she turned her gaze in that direction and saw a rabbit standing quietly on the balcony of the guest room.
(It’s been a while, Iris.)
“Yes, it’s been a while. It’s unusual for you to come to a place where there are so many people. Is there something wrong?”
(Well, yes. I had some business to attend to in this country. First of all, I came to your place to exchange information as well as to give you a brief update.)
“I see… Okay, come on in. I will prepare a cup of tea for you now.”
The rabbit was invited in and looked around the guest room curiously.
(Is there no servant for such a luxurious room?)
“I turned that down. I can take care of myself, and more than anything, they distract me.”
(I see. More importantly, was it okay to invite me in without permission?)
“Just come in now… It’s okay. Above all, you are also an existence that bears the name Holy, so I think you are rather welcomed, don’t you?”
(Hmm. Human nature is really simple to understand.)
“Oh, if you put it that way, I’m also human.”
(An existence that bears the name Holy is no longer an ordinary human being.)
“That’s terrible; it sounds like I’m a monster…”
After preparing tea for the two of them, Iris sat down in front of the rabbit and asked again.
“So? You came all the way to see me, and I wonder if something happened?”
(──The Fist Saint has fallen to the Evil.)
“! …I see.”
Iris quietly opened her mouth and took a sip of tea.
“…I was able to predict it because of the information I received to some extent.”
(Yeah. Everyone knew that he was the most uncontrollable of all the Holy. That’s why it wasn’t too surprising that he fell into Evil. But he used his power to start hunting other Holy ones.)
“…I see. So that’s why we lost contact with many of them.”
For a moment, a sad expression appeared on her face, but she soon said this in a calm tone.
“But even if the Fist Saint has fallen into the Evil, there are still some Holy who could stop the Fist Saint from going out of control, right? For example, the Bow Saint is…”
(…She was killed by humans.)
“What?”
Iris was taken aback by the rabbit’s words.
Holy is an existence that protects human beings from Evil. Yet, she was killed by humans, the object of her protection. It was difficult not to be surprised.
“W-what do you mean? That girl who loved humans the most was killed by humans…”
(…Yeah. But it was the Evil who made it work that way. The humans instigated by the Evil killed the Bow Saint.)
“Is that so? …That’s why I thought I’d seen a lot of Evil Beasts lately…”
(Are there a lot of them?)
“Yes. I had a vague idea about the Evil Beasts from the information of the Fist Saint and the situation of the other Holy, but the fact that the Evil Beasts have sprung up means that they are starting to move in full scale.”
(…I guess. The fact that Evil Beasts are popping up everywhere is proof of how much negative power is pouring out. It’s only a matter of time before we have to move.)
“So, do you know how many Holy are left?”
When Iris asked him that, Usagi made a pained expression.
(I’m not sure. It seems that Magic Saint is still alive… but the others were either hunted by the Fist Saint or fell into the Evil as well.)
“As I thought, there are other Holy who have fallen to the Evil…”
Iris, who knew the information but did not want to believe it, let out a sigh of regret. After talking that much, Iris realized something.
“Come to think of it… you said you had business in this country, but were you also invited by the King of Regal? I thought you were a Holy who was not good at interacting with humans…”
(Oh, is that what you think?)
The rabbits smiled at Iris’s words.
(You’re going to have a match today, aren’t you?)
“Eh? But how do you know that? What? No way, that opponent is you?”
(No. Unfortunately not.)
“So… if it’s not you, then who’s it going to be? I haven’t heard any details about the opponent yet… but if I may say so, I don’t think there is anyone who can compete with me properly.”
(Don’t worry. You’re dealing with an extraordinary talent.)
“Wait a minute. Why are you talking like you know about my opponent?”
(That’s because your opponent is my disciple.)
“!”
The rabbit’s words caused Iris to widen her eyes.
“Your disciple, you say…? Did you take a disciple? It seems to me that you’re the most unlikely person to take a disciple, along with the Fist Saint.”
With Iris’s honest impression, the rabbit averts its gaze grimly.
(Hmm. You thought of me as the same as the Fist Saint, huh? But… Well, I can understand how you feel about that. I’m training him because I think he’d be an excellent disciple for me.)
“You praise him so much… This disciple of yours seems to be quite strong, doesn’t he?”
(Hmm… Well, you can look forward to it. If you’re not careful, you could be tripped up.)
“…I see. I’ll keep that in mind.”
After exchanging information that way, Iris, curious about the rabbit’s disciple, moved to the arena to watch the fighting competition before her match.

Part 2
  “What an amazing crowd…”
After Lexia-san and Luna took us around the city and enjoyed various things, we came to the arena where the match would be held. It seemed that a fighting tournament was being held before the main event, the grand match, and we decided to watch it.
However, as soon as the tournament was over, we entered the arena through the back entrance instead of the regular entrance to immediately prepare for the main event.
When the arena attendant saw Lexia-san, he led us to a room. It was a room with a massive wooden door, and the decorations were quite luxurious, but I wondered who was inside.
“His Majesty is waiting for you here.”
“Eh?”
“Very well.”
To my surprise, it seemed that the king of Regal was in the room, and I panicked at the sudden meeting with the king.
“W-wait a minute! I’m not wearing any formal attire…!”
“Don’t worry! Yuuya-sama is already a noble even if he’s not wearing anything!”
“That doesn’t sound like a reason, does it?”
What does it mean to be noble even if I’m not wearing anything? It’s not just me, but there’s also Yuti, Night, and the others along with me.
Luna opened her mouth in a dumbfounded manner, perhaps sensing my concern.
“Well, I guess everything will be fine. If I may say so, Yuuya was caught up in their convenience. I don’t think he’s going to get upset over something like this.”
“I-is that so?”
“Suggestion. If he gets mad at you, just leave.”
“That would be even worse!”
What should I do? I’m so nervous…!
As I panicked, the attendant who had shown us in knocked on the door, and I heard a voice from inside saying that we were allowed to enter. The attendant opened the door, and Lexia-san walked proudly inside.
I also hurriedly entered the room while bowing to the attendant who was opening the door for me. Inside the room, there were two cool middle-aged men who looked like foreign actors and a woman in a dress about our age waiting for us.
All of us entered the room, but Owen-san and the other soldiers seemed to be waiting outside the room and didn’t come in. Well, I suppose since we’re going to meet the king of another country, they must look intimidating or have some other reason I don’t understand. Still, Luna was there, so Lexia-san’s escort was in place.
Then, a man in exceptionally luxurious clothes welcomes us with open arms.
“Oh, Lexia-dono! Nice to see you again.”
“Yes, it seems that Orghis-sama has not changed at all…”
While I was completely deflated by the room’s atmosphere, Lexia-san and a person who looked like the King of Regal (?) started the conversation with a smile. However, although the conversation seemed to be friendly, I felt a sense of dread.
Luna, as Lexia-san’s bodyguard, was standing in the rear, and Night was quiet as usual. Akatsuki and Ouma-san were the only ones who looked bored and were sighing.
Yuti looked around curiously as if this room was something unusual, and I was the only one who seemed to be nervous about the situation. Oh, that’s strange. Is it weird that I’m this nervous?
I was frozen in place, but I suddenly felt a gaze on me, and when I turned my head in that direction, I saw the woman in a dress staring blankly at me.
“U-um… is there something wrong?”
“Huh? N-no, it’s nothing!”
“I-I see…”
My mind almost went blank thinking I had done something wrong, but apparently I had not. If so, why was she watching me? …Ah, it’s probably because she doesn’t know who I am, it seems that might be the reason.
When I was convinced that way, the man who was conversing with Lexia-san turned his attention to me.
“Speaking of which… is that gentleman? It seems he has a lot of companions with him…”
“Yes, that’s right. This is my fiancée, Yuuya-sama!”
“Eh? Fiancée?”
It was true that she had asked me to marry her, but I refused before. Luna then opened her mouth with a dumbfounded look.
“…Lexia. Don’t annoy Yuuya too much.”
“That’s fine! You win when you say it!”
“That’s just a pity.”
I’m sorry, Lexia-san. I think Luna is right, too…
I bowed my head and introduced myself to the man who was stunned by Lexia-san’s words.
“I’m Yuuya Tenjou.”
“Introduction. I’m Yuti.”
After me, Yuti said briefly. I went on to introduce Night and the others as well.
“These are my family members, Night, Akatsuki, and Ouma-san.”
“Woof!”
“Fugo!”
“Hmph…”
Night barked interestingly, but Akatsuki waved one of his paws indifferently. Ouma-san didn’t even move from his prone position. Before I could rush to warn Ouma-san and Akatsuki, the man opened his mouth in surprise.
“T-this is… the first time I’ve seen a dragon that speaks human language… I’ve heard the rumors, but I never thought you really tamed the Ancient Dragon.”
“Eh?”
When the man said the word “Ancient Dragon,” I couldn’t help but tilt my head───.
“──What are you saying?”
“───.”
The next moment, a tremendous amount of intimidation took over the room. It was pressure that came from Ouma-san and was directed at the man in front of me.
Nevertheless, all the glass in the room was broken, and the walls even cracked. T-the pressure alone can affect the surroundings to this extent…
However, for the man who seemed to be the king, the other man, and the woman in the dress who were directly being subjected to the pressure, their faces were white beyond blue, and they were shaking.
“I will ask you again. What do you call me just now?”
“Ah, that’s…”
I froze in surprise, not expecting such a sudden release of pressure, but I hurriedly called out to Ouma-san.
“O-Ouma-san, stop! You can’t do that!”
“Yuuya, why are you stopping me? They’ve lumped me in with the likes of those Ancient Dragon. How can I allow them to insult me like that?”
“No, I don’t know what this Ancient Dragon is anyway…”
“No way! You have to know at least that!”
Ouma-san opened his eyes and stared at me as if he couldn’t believe what I was saying. At that point, the pressure that had dominated the room earlier disappeared, and the people who had been liberated by the pressure fell to their knees on the ground, panting desperately for breath.
“Oh, sorry, I am so sorry!”
I hurriedly approached them, lending them my shoulder and asking them to sit on the chairs in the room. Then, apparently dissatisfied with my words, Ouma-san started to complain.
“Hey, Yuya. Why are you apologizing?”
“I don’t know what was so unpleasant for you, Ouma-san, but if you felt insulted, then it must be the truth that it was so unpleasant for you. But the pressure Ouma-san applied was too much for a normal person to endure, you know? Besides, everyone is meeting Ouma-san for the first time today, so it’s natural that they don’t know about you. That’s why I’m apologizing to everyone for not being able to stop Ouma-san.”
“Ugugu…”
Ouma groaned at my words and lay down again, looking dejected.
However…
“…I’m sorry then.”
Yes, he uttered a single word of apology. The man, who seemed to have finally caught his breath, opened his mouth with a tense look on his face.
“M-me too… I am very sorry… it seems that the story about the Genesis Dragon is true…”
“Yes. I’m not the same as those small fries. You should be aware of that.”
“Eh, an Ancient Dragon is considered a small fry…”
The other man muttered in a shaky voice.
I’m not sure, but it seems that for Ouma-san, the Ancient Dragon is weak, but for humans, it’s a tremendous existence. Well, dragons can’t be considered weak; on the contrary, Ouma-san is too strong.
As I was thinking about this, a woman in a dress opened her mouth with her eyes wide open.
“B-but the legendary dragon was supposed to have been defeated by the Sage in the legend…”
“Layla!”
The man hurriedly chastised her for her stupefied speech.
Did she say Sage just now?
When I was surprised by the woman’s words, Ouma-san averted his gaze awkwardly.
“…I was just in the middle of a youthful rage when he beat me up and stopped me. From that point on, I stayed quiet, and that’s probably why everyone is talking about me being defeated.”
It is true that when I met Ouma-san, he said something like that. The other men were stunned by Ouma-san’s explanation, but then a man in gorgeous clothes laughed out loud.
“Hahahahahaha! I didn’t know that! I see. It seems that the Sage in the legend was an extraordinary person, wasn’t he?”
“Hmph… that’s right. I don’t think there will be a better person than him. Or maybe───.”
“Hmm?”
For some reason, Ouma-san turned his gaze to me when he was about to say that much. What is it? Then he just laughed at me and said nothing. What is it, really?
Then the man in the gorgeous clothes cleared his throat.
“Ahem. Now, we haven’t introduced ourselves yet. I am Orghis, the King of Regal. The man over here is the Prime Minister, Royle. And this is my daughter, Layla.”
“Ah, hello…”
I involuntarily gave the two of them an elegant bow and bailed them out. It’s not good. I’m not sure I have enough manners or class!
“No, however… Yuuya-dono does not seem to be from around here from the sound of his name, but… Yuuya-dono is quite a man, isn’t he?”
“I-is that so?”
“No, no, you have a legendary dragon with you. If this isn’t outstanding, who would you call it?”
“Haha…”
Is that really the case? It’s not that Ouma-san wanted to be tamed by me; it’s just that I happened to tame him…
Thinking about that, the King of the Regal Kingdom… Orghis-sama, gave me a sharp look.
“If this is the case, there is no need to worry when the Evil attacks, right?”
“Eh? No, um… I don’t think that Ouma-san is going to help us fight the Evil…”
“Huh?
Hearing my words, not only Orghis-sama but also Royle-san and Layla-sama froze. On the other hand, Lexia-san and the others are also surprised.
“W-what does that mean? In other words, the legendary dragon… Ouma-sama, is not going to lend us a hand?”
“Um…”
While Orghis-sama flinched with a menacing look from Ouma-san, Ouma-san then snickered and opened his mouth.
“Hmph. Humans are so daring. I’m not interested in the Holy or the Evil. You can deal with it on your own.”
“That’s what he said…”
“No way…”
Orghis-sama muttered regretfully from the bottom of his heart and sat down helplessly.
Although I understand how he feels, it is also true that it has nothing to do with Ouma-san. Although it seems that if he wanted to, he could destroy both the Holy and the Evil, but it’s not that he himself is being attacked. And from his point of view, he’s probably not interested in the existence of humans themselves.
If that’s the case, the concern about the conflict between the Holy and the Evil is completely for the humans’ convenience, and it would be strange to involve Ouma-san in it. Well, to be honest, I’d be happy if he could help us, but if he doesn’t want to, I can’t force him.
When Orghis-sama and the others were in a darker mood than expected, Lexia-san finally couldn’t hold back and spoke up.
“You’ve been talking like this is a fairy tale for a while now, but what do you mean when you say the Evil is going to attack?”
“…I see. We have heard about it from the Sword Saint, so we know about it to some extent, but… Lexia-dono and the others still don’t know about it.”
Orghis-sama said so quietly.
“The world is in a crisis right now. I also thought it was only in fairy tales, but the existence of Evil is threatening the world now…”
“Evil?”
“Yes. Have you ever heard of the Holy and the Evil?”
“Yes, well…”
“I’ve heard it in legends, too. I have heard that the Evil, which is a collection of the negative aspects of humanity, and the Holy, which protects humanity from the Evil, have been fighting for a long time…”
“You’re right. And they are not just fairy tales; they are actual stories.”
“No way…”
“And from what I’ve heard from the Sword Saint, it seems that the Evil is on the move again and is trying to attack us, humans.”
“Affirmative. It’s true.”
“Yes, it is. I woke up because I was hungry and also because the smell of the Holy and Evil was too intense.”
Not only did Yuti say that, but Ouma-san also confirmed that and Lexia-san and the others had no choice but to believe it.
Then, while Yuti said with great confidence, Orghis-sama tilted his head in wonder.
“Um… Yuti, was it? You said it quite confidently; what is your basis?”
“Foolish question. I’m a disciple of the Bow Saint. So I know.”
“What?”
“Ah, I’m also a disciple of the Kicking Saint.”
“””Eeeeeehhhh!?”””
When I told them that, Orghis-sama and Royle-san, and Layla-sama raised their voices in surprise.
“N-not only you have a legendary dragon with you, but you’re also a disciple of the Holy…?”
“W-what an extraordinary person…”
“…..”
While everyone was staring at me, Lexia-san, for some reason, was the only one who seemed to be proud.
“That’s right! Yuuya-sama is amazing!”
“No, why are you so proud?”
“Because I’m his wife!”
“No, you’re not!”
She’s been promoted herself from my fiancée to my wife! I could only be amazed at how flexible Lexia-san was.
“I see… If he’s this good, it’s no wonder that Yuuya-dono is as powerful as Sword Saint-dono.”
“Right?”
“But, the Sword Saint is also a monster, you know? …Well, Yuuya-dono is a disciple of the Kicking Saint, and I think I don’t need to tell you how powerful the Holy is…”
“Hahaha…”
Master Usagi is powerful! That’s because I can’t fight properly without using the power of Evil, which I’ve recently been able to handle a bit.
Well, if I use the power of Evil, Master Usagi’s status as a Holy will be forced to be released and doubled. But the fact that Evil’s power can be used to fight even such a Holy means that Evil’s power is that powerful as well.
Recalling Kuro, who has been sleeping more often since the Fist Saint’s attack, I once again recognized the danger of Evil.
“Well, okay. I would have liked to talk about such difficult topics, but today is our country’s national festival. Let’s forget about that and just enjoy today.”
“Y-yes.”
“Oh, yes. We have a good view of the upcoming tournament. Would you like to watch it from here?”
“Yes, let’s do that.”
Lexia-san nodded to Orghis-sama’s suggestion, and we decided to watch from this special seat. This room is located high up in the arena and overlooks the entire arena, so you can clearly see the battle.
Then, Lexia-san pulled my arm.
“Yuuya-sama, let’s watch together!”
“Eh? Ah, yes.”
I sat down next to Lexia-san while she pulled my arm, and on the opposite side of Lexia-san, Layla-sama, the princess of the Regal Kingdom, sat down.
“Yuuya-sama. May I sit next to you as well?”
“Eh? Yes, it’s fine…”
I looked around, but the seat in this special room was still empty. On the contrary, there is a seat available next to the king of this country, Orghis-sama, but is it okay for Layla-sama to watch with us?
Ah, rather, because her country is hosting this kind of event that it is necessary to entertain the princess of other countries such as Lexia-san?
“Mumu…”
As Layla-sama’s actions convinced me, I suddenly heard such a groan from Lexia-san next to me.
“Hmm? What’s wrong, Lexia-san?”
“…No, nothing.”
“Huh…?”
It doesn’t feel any different, but I think it’s better not to touch…
In contrast to Lexia-san, Layla-sama smiled and put her hand on my hand.
“La-Layla-sama!?”
“Ara, you don’t have to call me with an honorific. Please feel free just to call me Layla.”
“N-no, that’s just…”
“T-that’s right! Why on earth did you hold his hand in the middle of all this? Yuuya-sama is my fiancée!”
“Um, that’s a bit of a misstatement…”
Lexia-san said that in panic at Layla-sama’s behavior, but Layla-sama only smiled leisurely.
“But Yuuya-sama said it’s not like that. Isn’t it just a misunderstanding on Lexia-sama’s part?”
“N-no, I’m not mistaken! It’s true! It’s true! In my mind!”
“I’m not saying it’s true, but…”
“A-anyway! Please don’t interfere with Yuuya-sama and me!”
In response to Lexia-san’s words, Layla-sama’s smile turned bitter.
“Since I’m the royal family of the Regal Kingdom, where magic research is very active, I think I can give Yuuya-sama a more detailed explanation of the magic that will be used in the upcoming tournament than anyone else, isn’t it?”
“Umm, that’s…”
Lexia-san closed her mouth involuntarily at Layla-sama’s words.
Certainly, I’ve heard that the Regal Kingdom is a magic powerhouse, and as a royal family member of the Regal Kingdom, Layla-sama would be able to explain to me what magic I don’t know.
I don’t have any problem using magic thanks to Sage-san’s magic circuits and magic theory, but I don’t know anything about other commonly known magic. I’d appreciate it if she would explain it to me.
“So, may I take your word for it?”
“Yes, of course.”
“Mugugu…!”
When I asked Layla-sama again, she smiled, and Lexia-san had a regretful expression on her face. Um… I’m sorry about that. I was just curious about the magic…
As I inwardly apologized for Lexia-san’s situation, I remembered something.
“That reminds me, where is the Sword Saint?”
I heard that the match is going to be held after this tournament, and I asked about the Sword Saint, who will be my opponent. Orghis-sama, who was sitting some distance away, smiled.
“Oh, Sword Saint-dono is waiting in the guest room until the match. Before the match begins, Yuuya-dono and Sword Saint-dono will be summoned by the officials, so please follow them.”
“Understood.”
“Umu. ──let’s start now.”
Orghis-sama said, slowly stood up and stood in a position where all the audience could see him. Then, something that looked like a microphone was placed in front of Orghis-sama. Then he opened his mouth to the microphone.
At that moment, Orghis-sama’s voice echoed throughout the arena, and all the excited spectators fell silent to listen to his words. I don’t know what the principle is, but it must be a magic tool with the same purpose as a microphone.
As I wondered what kind of magic was being used, I couldn’t help but notice that Orghis-sama’s opening speech was over, and the crowd was getting excited. I’m sorry… I didn’t listen to you properly…
When I moved my gaze to the arena while feeling sorry for myself, I saw that the first match was about to take place, and a strong man and a slender man in robes appeared in the arena.
Did they look like two opposites, a magician and a warrior perhaps?
When the battle began, the strong man charged the robed man with his huge sword, swinging it as he looked. However, the man in robes kept his distance from the attack, chanted something, and pointed his palm at the strong man.
Then, a fireball shot out from his palm, aiming at the strong man.
I hadn’t had many opportunities to see other people use magic, so it was refreshing to see someone else shoot magic.
“That’s a fireball, a fire attribute magic. If you’re a regular magician, you’ll need two more chants to cast a spell of that power, but that magician seems to be skilled enough to shorten it.”
“H-hou…”
Layla-sama explained it to me, but I couldn’t really understand how amazing it was.
Of course, the monsters in the Great Devil’s Nest use magic, but they don’t chant like that. And, as it was written in Sage-san’s book, people generally shoot magic while chanting.
If I’m following Layla-sama’s explanation, it seems like it takes a bit longer chanting to release the magic of that power, but with the knowledge of Sage-san, I couldn’t say for sure.
Moreover, when I looked closely, I saw that the man in the robe was only using fire, so there seemed to be a binding attribute as well. According to Sage-san’s book, chanting was unnecessary, and attributes were irrelevant, but what’s essential was imagination, so I guess this Sage-san’s way of thinking differed from other people’s.
As I watched the fight with a fresh mind, the warrior man eventually won by cornering the magician man and pushing him away. I’ve been training with Yuti a lot lately, so I’m slowly gaining experience fighting against others. However, it’s still not enough, so watching others fight like this is a great learning experience.
It’s not something that can be applied to all battles in the arena’s limited space, but it’s still a valuable experience. As the matches progressed, the level of the competition increased as the winners fought each other.
The final match was swordsman against swordsman, and it was a fierce sword fight. I watched the fight closely and concentrated on trying to make the moves as my own. In the past, it was not easy to watch and learn the moves of those who were stronger than a certain level or to steal their techniques.
But now, for some reason, I was confident that I could perfectly master the moves of the swordsmen and magicians who were engaged in fierce battles in the tournament in front of me. What is it? This feeling…
As I was puzzled by the sensation that I had never felt before, the match finally came to an end. Then there was a knock on the door of the room, and an official walked in.
“Excuse me. I’m here to invite the opponent of Sword Saint-sama…”

Part 3
  “Excuse me. I’m here to invite the opponent of Sword Saint-sama…”
“…..”
“Hmm? Yuuya?”
“Eh? Y-yeah, what?”
“Invitation. Yuuya, you have been called.”
“Oh, is it my turn already…?
“…Are you okay?”
Because of my lack of response, Yuti looked into my face with concern.
“No, I’m fine. It’s just that I was watching the fight earlier and was surprised that I seemed to be able to handle myself better than I expected…”
“…I understand. Is it the harmful effects of that time? Or a benefit?”
“That time?”
I’m not sure what Yuti was referring to, but I don’t have time to ask. As soon as I tried to follow the attendant, Lexia-san and the others gave me words of support.
“If it’s you, Yuuya-sama, you can definitely win! Please do your best!”
“Go show them what you’re capable of!”
“Woof!”
“Buhi~.”
“Hmm. Holy, huh? At best, they can only scratch my foot.”
I don’t know if Ouma-san was cheering me on, but I’m going to do my best so I don’t end up showing disgraceful behavior. I made up my mind and followed the attendant.
“Please wait in this waiting room.”
When I entered the waiting room, I found Master Usagi inside.
“Ah, Master Usagi!”
(It’s finally coming, huh?)
When Master Usagi saw me, he smiled.
“Yes, well… or rather, I heard you were headed to the Sword Saint, but what were you doing there?”
(We just exchanged some information and talked about how good you are. That’s good. The Sword Saint will fight you seriously, you know?)
“Why did you do that?”
I’m not confident I can last five seconds if the Sword Saint really comes at me, you know?
Master Usagi gave a stern look at the dumbfounded me.
(What are you talking about? If the opponent isn’t serious, it wouldn’t be a training exercise.)
“Uh, that may be true, but…”
(And also, when you fight, don’t show a poor appearance, okay? If you lose, the quality of me as your master will be questioned.)
“You being unreasonable here!”
Isn’t it impossible for me to win if the Sword Saint is serious? What should I do?
N-no, this is Master Usagi’s way of encouraging me! Yes, that must be it! Let’s just believe that…!
I don’t know how serious the opponent would be, but if I were to ask Master Usagi that, he’d probably tell me to really try and win, so I kept my mouth shut.
I was sweating uncontrollably, and I suddenly realized something.
“C-come to think of it, Master Usagi was here from the beginning, but… did anyone guide you here…?”
(No? I entered on my own.)
“You just do whatever you please, don’t you?”
I had a feeling it was that, but…
I was stunned by Master Usagi’s sense of freedom, but I suddenly decided to ask him about the strange feeling I was experiencing with my eyes.
“Um, Master. Since defeating the Fist Saint, my eyesight has become strangely better. Perhaps I can see faster movement, or perhaps I can absorb the techniques I see…”
(…What?)
Master Usagi made a dubious expression at my words and pondered on his own.
(…Could it be that… Indeed, at that time too…?)
“Um, Master Usagi?”
When I tried to call out to Master Usagi, who had started pondering by himself, the attendant came back to call me again.
“Excuse me. Now… Eh, a rabbit?”
The attendant who came in tilted his head when he saw Master Usagi in the room, and I hurriedly opened my mouth.
“Oh, don’t worry about it! Anyway, can I go now?”
“Eh? Ah, yes. I’ll show you the way.”
“Well then, Master Usagi. I’ll go now.”
(Yeah, go ahead.)
After being sent off by Master Usagi, I moved to the entrance of the arena.
At that time, I have changed my clothes to the [Bloody War Demon Series] so that I can be ready to fight at any time and have everything prepared. However, I took off my helmet so that my face could be seen, as I was about to meet the Sword Saint for the first time.
After waiting for a while, I heard the voice of Orghis-sama.
It seems that he is giving an explanation about the match… I-it’s not good. I’m getting nervous…!
But unfortunately, time does not wait for me, and before long, Orghis-sama’s speech seemed to be over, and I went through the entrance.
Then, I flinched in the face of the cheers that went up all at once. I-I can’t believe the crowd is this huge…!
When I was in the audience, I didn’t particularly care about the number of people watching, probably because I had a strong sense that I was part of the audience, but when I stood in front of them all, the cheers were so overwhelming that I almost backed away.
But there was no way I would run away, so I put a lot of pressure on my stomach and managed to hold my ground.
“───So you are the Usagi’s apprentice, huh?”
“Eh?”
A woman’s voice reached my ears as the crowd cheered loudly. As I turned my gaze towards the voice, a woman came through the entrance on the opposite side of the arena from me, her eyes still closed.
The woman had an elegant presence that seemed out of place with the arena, and I could have been convinced that she was a noblewoman. However, the sword on her hip and the woman’s overwhelming presence made me understand that the woman in front of me was my opponent, the Sword Saint.
“Ah, you are the Sword Saint…?”
Eeeeehh? N-no way! I’ve heard that she is the strongest of the Holy, so I thought she would be more stern and scary, but she’s not at all what I imagined!
“Yes, that’s right. I’m Iris, the Sword Saint. And you──!”
The woman in front of me─Iris-san slowly opened her eyes and then froze in surprise when she saw my face.
“Eh…wha… eh?”
“U-um… what is it?”
When I asked her about her unexpected reaction, she suddenly put her hands on her cheeks and suddenly crouched down.
    “W-what’s this feeling in my chest…? C-could it be that… this is love?”
“U-um…?”
“Ah? It’s nothing. I’m only interested in men who are stronger than me.”
“H-huh…? I-is that so?”
What the heck is she talking about…?
Iris-san then cleared her throat as I was trying to figure out what was going on.
“Hmm! And you are?”
“Ah, I’m the disciple of the Kicking Saint, Yuuya Tenjou.”
“H-hmm… Yuuya-kun, right? …B-by the way, how old are you?”
“Huh? Well, I’m 16…”
“Kuh! There’s about a ten-year age difference… N-no! It’s not uncommon for people to have an age difference these days! I mean, it’s something to be envied!”
I don’t know what she’s been talking about since a while ago. I don’t know, but I’ve been getting chills since a while back…
As I shivered involuntarily, Iris-san, who had been strangely excited a moment ago, suddenly gave me a sharp look.
“Well, but… if you don’t have the ability, we can’t talk about it.”
“…Of course, I’ll give it my all.”
I took out my [Omni-Sword] and held it up quietly.
“All right, bring it on.”
At the end of Iris-san’s words, the signal to start the fight was finally given, and I stepped in with all my might and slashed at Iris-san.
But…
“You will never reach me with that.”
“!?”
My attack was deflected with a clear metallic sound before it could reach Iris-san! However, as I did so, I noticed that Iris-san’s arm had momentarily blurred.
“Don’t tell me… you swung your sword in that instant?”
“Huh? You can see it clearly, huh. It usually ends up that no one can recognize it…”
Seeing Iris-san smiling amusingly, I can not stop my cold sweat.
No, no, isn’t that too outrageous? What should I do against a sword that was swung at an almost unrecognizable speed? Moreover, looking at Iris-san now, her sword is properly sheathed. It’s not a move that can be done in an instant.
Then, Iris-san smiled provocatively at the stunned me.
“By any chance, you’re not going to say that this is the end, are you?”
Of course, I wouldn’t say that this was the end, but it was definitely my best effort. But Iris-san easily blocked the attack. What’s more, it’s not as if it’s been enhanced by any particular magic.
…I already knew that, but the difference is so great that I can only smile bitterly.
Looking at me like that, Iris-san made a suspicious expression on her face.
“Hmm? You don’t seem to be in too much of a hurry, are you?”
“No, it’s not… I was in such a hurry that I became calm.”
“I see. So, do you want to give up?”
“No way…!”
It was obvious to me that my power would not work. Then I had to do what I could.
When I ran forward again, I put away my [Omni-Sword] and took out my [Absolute Spear] from my [Item Box].
“A spear?”
“Haaah!”
Aiming at Iris-san, who tilted her head, I threw the [Aboslute spear] in all seriousness. However, with a clear metallic sound again, the spear was easily repelled.
“What do you think you’re doing… such an attack───.”
“Fuh.”
“Wha-?”
Immediately after I threw the [Absolute Spear], I already had a new weapon in my hand; it was the [Formless Bow ], and then I shot several invisible arrows.
“Huh?”
Iris-san didn’t seem to understand what I was doing for a moment, but it seems that she sensed the invisible arrows I shot, and a metallic sound rang out again, and all of my arrows were flicked off.
“…I’m surprised. My sword can be slashed at a speed that can’t be tracked by the eyes, but I didn’t think it would really be an invisible arrow───.”
“Haaa!”
“T-there’s more?”
It seemed that Iris-san was talking about something, but in order for me to fight Iris-san properly, I could not give Iris-san the time to attack me; I had to attack her one-sidedly with a saturated attack, so I continued to attack her relentlessly.
Even so, my attacks were still handled by her sword with a speed that couldn’t be followed by the eyes. Then I launched the [Absolute Spear] at Iris-san again, which had just returned to me, with a kick that was directly taught by Master Usagi.
Iris-san rolled her eyes when she saw the powerful spear that suddenly entered the uninterrupted barrage of arrows.
“Wait, no way!”
The [Absolute Spear], which was more powerful than the one I threw at her a few moments ago, couldn’t be easily deflected by Iris-san. It’s the first time I’ve seen her take it seriously with her sword since the mock battle began.
“Kuh… This is…!”
Iris-san was still able to block the [Absolute Spear]… but I was waiting for that momentary gap in her defense.
“Haaaaaaaaa!”
“Huh? Wait… That big hammer of yours, it looks like it’s something dangerous.”
Yes, I was preparing to attack with my [World Strike].
Unlike other weapons, this weapon has a large gap, so it is difficult to hit. However, if I could hit it, it would be powerful enough to defeat any opponent. After all, it carries mass equal to that of the world in the attack.
In addition, in order to increase the certainty, I also deploy the [Magic Attire] for the first time here. Then, a pale blue light gushed out of my body and burst like a bolt of lightning.
Iris-san’s eyes widened at the sight of me.

Part 4
  ” …Now what…?”
That’s the best I can do.
But───.
“───!”
“Uh?”
Iris-san stared at my [World Strike] with a thoughtful expression. Just before her sword collided with my [World Strike], she guided its movement with her sword, as if to catch all the impact of the collision. The impact from [World Strike] went straight into the nothingness.
However, it seemed that it was not easy to receive this attack, even for Iris-san herself, and she did not have the time to follow up on my gap after the attack.
“This kind of… attack… is just not possible…”
Iris-san’s face distorted, and she stared at her hands. When I looked closely, her hand was trembling slightly; maybe she was numb. No, I don’t think it’s possible to take on a mass equal to the world and only get numb.
However, now that my strongest attack was blocked, I don’t think this move will work again in the future. I had taken advantage of an opening since she hadn’t seen it before, but I don’t think I’ll be able to do the same next time.
Iris-san had a serious expression on her face as I broke out in a cold sweat.
“It’s not that I was careless, but… it was too unexpected. Who are you really?”
“Who am I? Even if you ask me that…”
“Okay, fine. But you do understand that your attack is no longer going to work, right? …What are you going to do about it?”
Now that the [World Strike] that has been strengthened by [Magic Attire] was prevented, there is almost nothing else I can do.
Iris-san suddenly smiled at me as I desperately thought about it.
“Fuh… Well, Yuuya-kun was the one who attacked until now, so now I will be the one to attack, okay?”
“!?”
At that moment, the dynamic eyesight and thinking speed enhanced by [Magic Attire] succeeded in barely catching the movement of Iris-san. And when I reflexively took out my [Omni-Sword] and took a defensive posture, I felt a tremendous impact on my hand.
“Ara, I didn’t think you would be able to block the first attack. But if you take it directly, your hands won’t be able to withstand it, you know?”
“Kuh!”
As Iris-san said, my arm was numb from the blow I just received. If I can’t take the impact, as well as Iris-san did, I’ll probably be killed in no time.
However…
“Well, I won’t give you time to pass it off.”
“Ugh!”
I was overwhelmed by the raging sword attack. I managed to hang on by strengthening my physical abilities and eyesight using the [Magic Attire]. Still, if I had been in my normal state, I would have been killed with the first blow.
“I’m surprised… you can prevent this as well. Are you really Usagi’s disciple?”
“Yes, I am…!”
“…That’s a formidable talent, considering you’ve just learned to use a sword. But unfortunately, I’m going to have to push through.”
“Kuh?”
Iris-san’s attack speed gradually increased, and even my enhanced dynamic eyesight could no longer track her.
But…
“?”
Iris-san noticed a strange feeling and tilted her head. I also noticed the discomfort later.
(Huh…? How come I can’t follow it with my eyes, but I can react to it…?)
Yes, Iris-san was swinging her sword at a speed that I could not possibly handle, but somehow I could block her attack. Iris-san tilted her head and increased her speed to push through, but my body still reacted and stopped the attack.
In the end, Iris-san rolled her eyes at this situation.
“No way! How can you still react?”
I gave up on following it with my eyes and let my body react for some reason, but it seemed to be able to respond to the point where Iris-san was surprised. W-what is it?
I was puzzled because I myself didn’t know why my body was able to react to such a degree. It was as if my body had experienced combat at this level before…
Since I could handle all of her attacks, Iris-san once again took distance.
“Hah… hah…”
“…It’s weird. I’m not sure why you’re reacting when you can’t keep up with my movements… What on earth did you do?”
“I-I have no idea either…”
“Well, so you’re not going to tell me that easily, huh? But I wonder if you can outrun this as well…!”
When Iris-san said that, she closed the distance even faster than her first attack. With that, the ground cracked and shook the entire arena.
Then───.
“[Sword Flash]!”
It was still a fast, untraceable slash, but the power put into it was different. Earlier, she had focused on speed and the ability to strike repeatedly, but the blow she had just unleashed on me was a heavy blow that emphasized power.
Even if I could react as I had earlier, it would be the end of me if I took it directly. In order to overcome this attack, I have to negate the impact, just as Iris-san taken the impact of the [World Strike] earlier, or I will be cut down like this.
However, I don’t have that kind of skill… But──.
“!?”
The moment I received Iris-san’s sword with my [Omni-Sword], I turned my body around and received the impact while closing in on Iris-san.
“Kuh!”
Although Iris-san swung her sword down with all her might, she did not feel it as she drew back her sword and prevented the attack of my sudden approach, and then pushed me away.
“Are you really Usagi’s disciple? By all means, you are not at the level of a disciple, but a Holy class… no, you should be more than that!”
Iris-san was sweating as she said this. For some reason, when I saw Iris-san’s attack, I instinctively knew that I could pass it off. So, I was able to replicate the movements of Iris-san as she dodged my attack earlier. I not only evade it but also launch a counterattack.
However…
“I thought it was perfectly decided just now…”
I thought my counterattack was surprisingly clean, but as it turned out, it was blocked.
It’s still not possible to win against Master Usagi, and it’s no surprise that my attack didn’t work against Iris-san either, who is the Sword Saint, but I think I’m going to lose confidence if I’m blocked this easily.
In order to counter such Master Usagi, I need to release the Evil power, but… Is it really okay to release it now?
For the time being, I was able to control the Evil power for a very period, but I was more afraid that by releasing the Evil power, Iris-san would mistake me for the real Evil.
I don’t know how much Master Usagi has told her about me, but I’m sure he hasn’t told her about the Evil Power. Master Usagi himself said that I should be careful about showing it to the Holy.
When it comes to that, I have to beat Iris-san without the Evil power… Eh, it’s impossible, isn’t it?
When I was stunned by the situation that I was stuck in, Kuro, who had been asleep inside me until now, woke up with a big yawn.
“Fuwaaha… I slept well. And, oh…? Why are you fighting with the Sword Saint?”
“I’m sorry, Kuro. I don’t have time to explain it in detail, so I’ll make it short and simple: it just happened!”
“Whatever happens, but you’re fighting the Sword Saint… Aren’t you becoming more and more like the real Evil?”
“I wish you wouldn’t say anything so crazy!”
I also want to live in peace if possible!
But the Evil will attack me, so I have to get power to remain safe. The current situation is also a training to gain the power to resist the Evil.
Iris-san, who didn’t know about Kuro, tilted her head curiously when I complained about Kuro’s appearance after a long time.
“Who in the world are you talking to?”
“Eh? Ah, no, it’s just…”
“…Oh well. It seems that you’ve run out of cards, so let’s end this now.”
Iris-san said and turned a tremendous pressure on me.
Kuh… Iris-san used to move in a state where she was not strengthened by magic, but she seemed to have strengthened her body somehow. Obviously, the pressure I felt was stronger than before.
Kuro burst into laughter as I struggled to keep myself from being blown away by the pressure.
“Hahahaha! Hey, hey, you’re about to get hit, you know! What happened to you when you defeated the Fist Saint?”
“A-as I said, I don’t remember what happened at that time!”
“Well, I guess you’re right. You weren’t sane at the time, but you had completely transformed into Evil itself. Then, you have no choice but to lose now, right?”
“Ugh… Master Usagi will definitely be angry with me…”
As I was thinking about the situation, my face turned pale, and Iris-san quietly set up her sword.
“I’ll finish you off with a real, honest-to-goodness blow.”
“T-then, I’ll be dead…”
“Well, I guess you’re dead,” said Kuro.
“I don’t want to die!”
This is just like a mock battle, isn’t it? It’s not like anyone died or was seriously injured in the fighting tournament, right?
Iris-san smiled at me as if she was enjoying this battle while I was trembling even more.
“I also enjoyed fighting for the first time in a long time… Well, I wish you were stronger than me, though.”
“Huh?”
“───[Sacred Heaven Slash]!”
When Iris-san stepped forward, she moved in front of me in an instant. The speed was so instantaneous that I thought it was really an instantaneous movement, and I didn’t even realize that she had moved until she appeared in front of me.
And just as she was about to swing her sword down at me, my eyes, enhanced by my [Magic Attire], noticed a black something approaching from behind Iris-san at an unbelievable speed.
Then, not only me but also Kuro seemed to have noticed it and shouted in panic.
“Avoid it, Yuuya!”
“Huh?”
“Eh?”
I realized that Iris-san didn’t recognize the black something, so I pulled Iris-san’s arm in front of me and hugged her, and then we fell down together.
“W-w-w-wha-whaat!?”
The next moment, Iris-san’s face turned red, and she panicked as she was hugged by me. The next moment, the black something pierced the position where Iris-san and I were standing in an instant.
“Huh?”
“T-that was close…”
Iris-san stared dumbly at the ground where the black something had pierced. When the audience began to rustle at the sudden attack from outside the arena, a voice came from the sky.
“───Accha, it’s been avoided. Well, it wouldn’t be much fun if you died now, would it!”
“Wha…! That appearance… “Shinigami”…! And why are you with them?”
Iris-san’s eyes widened as she looked up into the sky. I also looked up at the sky and saw a boy, a half-naked man with a long spear on his back, and a ninja-like man with two grass-cutting scythes on his hips, standing there leisurely.

Chapter 6 – Attack
Part 1
  “Spear Saint! Scythe Saint!”
“Ehh?”
The unexpected words made me involuntarily turn my gaze back to Iris-san, and the half-naked man in the sky and the man in the ninja costume quietly shook their heads.
“…I do regret to inform you that we no longer hold that title.”
“We are the Fallen Saints.”
“Fa-Fallen Saints…?”
As I was tilting my head at the unfamiliar words, a boy with a different presence laughed in amusement.
“Hey~, that’s terrible that you ignored me. Besides, unfortunately~ they’re no longer the Holy that you know. They are the ones who have fallen to us and taken on new powers.”
“Fallen…? Uh! Could it be?”
While Iris-san made a startled expression as she realized something, the boy in the sky deepened his smile.
“Did you finally notice it? Then let’s get started~──the destruction.”
The moment the boy’s eyes glittered, the jet-black haze that I had seen in the past when I confronted Yuti and the Fist Saint erupted from the boy’s body. Then, a loud sound of destruction could be heard from far away. The sound of destruction gradually got closer and closer, and finally, the identity of the sound appeared in the arena.
“What is that? “
“──Giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!”
The sight made me stare in horror.
“What? This looks the same as what I saw at the shrine the other day…?”
A large number of what were known as “Evil Beasts” had rushed into the arena. The audience screamed and ran away from the sudden intruders, but the “Evil Beasts” attacked them without mercy.
“Ahahahahaha! The screams are wonderful!”
The boy who was probably the one who orchestrated this tragedy looked at the carnage around him with an ecstatic expression on his face.
“Stop it right now!”
Immediately, Iris-san unleashed a slash with divine speed towards the boy floating in the sky, but the slash was blocked by the black darkness overflowing from the boy’s body.
“Don’t be so impatient; let me at least introduce myself~.”
He laughed like a fool and bowed condescendingly.
“I’m Quarro, the Shinigami, and I’m one of the Evil. It’s nice to meet you～.”
“!”
The boy who smiled in front of me… Quarro, told us that he is one of the Evil, the sworn enemy of Master Usagi, Iris-san, and Yuti. The hint of Evil overflowing from his body was real, and Iris-san’s attitude also confirmed that Quarro really is an Evil.
Anyway, I hurriedly tried to move to help the audience, but the two men whom Iris-san had just called “Spear Saint” and “Scythe Saint” stood in front of me.
“…I’m sorry, but I don’t want you to disturb us.”
“That’s right. Therefore, we need you to die here.”
“What?”
“Yuuya-kun!”
Iris-san tried to help me when I was pressured by the tremendous spirit from the two of them, but Quarro stood in front of Iris-san’s eyes.
“Hey, isn’t it terrible that you’re ignoring me? I came here just to mess you up. I mean, don’t you want to run away or call your friends or something? Well, I’m not giving you any choice, though～.”
“…Sure, the situation is bad, and I don’t think I can handle it on my own, but I’m still a Holy, so I have to fight…!”
“Hmm. Well, why don’t you come at me?”
“…Fuh!”
While sensing that Iris-san and Quarro had begun fighting behind me, I thought about how I should move against the two Fallen Saints in front of me. If what Iris-san said was true, then I would have to deal with two former Holy.
Besides, judging from the situation and the word Fallen Saints, there is a possibility that they have acquired the power of the Evil as a result of them falling to the Evil. That would mean that I would have to deal with two enemies at the same level as the Fist Saint I fought previously.
Even Master Usagi couldn’t defeat the Evil Fallen Fist Saint, so how can I, in my normal state, win?
“When one problem is over, another appears. You really have a lot of troubles, don’t you?”
“…It’s not that I like having them, but…”
Kuro was also awake, and even though I don’t remember, if I use the Evil’s full power, as I did when I defeated the Fist Saint, I might be able to defeat them. However, suppose I used this power, it was still unstable and cannot be perfectly controlled. In that case, I will fall and become an Evil, just like Quarro, and I would become a target for the Holy to defeat as well.
But even now, as I’m struggling with this, the Evil Beasts were───.
At that moment when I thought about it,
“Gigi? Gii!”
“Giigigigi!”
“Gigyaaa!”
I saw countless arrows piercing through the Evil Beasts.
This arrow… Yuti? Also, following Yuti’s arrows, I heard the voices of my dependable family members.
“Grrrr… wooooff!”
“Buhi, buhi~.”
Night and Akatsuki defeated the Evil Beasts one after another and healed the injured audience. In such a scene, the men of the Fallen Saints opened their eyes.
“…What’s with that little wolf?”
“It’s not just the little wolf. That pig is also using a strange skill…”
Then, I noticed that Night, who was destroying the Evil Beast, looked at me for a moment.
He seemed to be saying, “Leave this to me,” and so I nodded.
“Now I can fight you guys with peace of mind.”
“Huh? Don’t say anything crazy. Do you really think that you alone can win against the two of us?”
(──That’s why I’m also fighting you two.)
“Huh?”
“M-Master Usagi!”
    Master Usagi appeared out of nowhere next to me and quietly looked at the men in front of us.
(…Hmph. I thought that some of the Holy had fallen to the Evil, but… I didn’t expect it to be you two. Spear Saint Ronus, and Scythe Saint Jin.)
Hearing Master Usagi’s words, the half-naked man with the spear on his back… who was probably Ronus, frowned slightly.
“…The weak will be eliminated. I’m just following that law of nature.”
(Hou? So, as a result of that, you became a servant of Evil? Fallen Saints, is it? How dare you call yourself that. You’re just a slave to Evil, aren’t you?)
“Say what you want. We gained new powers by submitting to the Evil. Those of the Holy who were eliminated were even weaker than us.”
Ronus and the Scythe Saint, Jin, each quietly raised their weapons. Seeing this, Master Usagi opened his mouth to direct me as he, too, entered a battle stance.
(Yuuya.)
“Huh?”
(For the moment, I’ve given a brief explanation of the current situation to Night, Yuti, and the others. The king of this country is probably planning some sort of countermeasure as well. As for the safety of that little girl, Yuti and the one who was with her as her escort are enough to handle it. So for now, just concentrate on defeating the people in front of you.)
“Y-yes!”
It seemed that Master Usagi had made a move, and one of my concerns had been resolved. However, I was wondering what Ouma-san is doing… Well, Ouma-san seemed to be sleeping without a care in this situation, so there’s no need to worry. I mean, he’s so strong that it’s ridiculous to worry about him.
Rather, I should be worried about myself, and I quickly redeployed my [Magic Attire]. Seeing me like that, Ronus swung his spear lightly and laughed with a snort.
“…Hmph. Did you finish your private conversation? If so, let’s go this way…!”
(Yuuya! I’ll leave that Ronus to you!)
“Yes!”
I immediately took out my [Absolute Spear] and clashed with Ronus’ spear.
“…Huh! It seems that you want to die so badly that you are challenging me with a spear! If so, I will kill you as you wish. [Whirlwind Drill]!”
Ronus pulled back his spear and thrust it out with great force. A whirlwind of air swirled around the spear as it pushed forward, cutting the ground. It was deflected by [Absolute Spear] with a narrow margin in the same way that I had deflected Iris-san’s attack.
“What… how can you deflect it?”
What was deflected was not only the spear but also the sharp whirlwind that was gathering on the tip of the spear, which made Ronus surprised. I didn’t think I’d be able to catch the wind myself, so I was secretly surprised.
“…Kuh! Don’t you dare make light of me!”
Then Ronus unleashed a raging wave of thrusts, piercing everywhere. However, I took a good look at them and carefully handled them one by one.
“…What are you…! You’re not even a Holy; you’re just a human being. How can you keep up with my techniques…!”
(Hmph. You can’t compare him to any other human being. He’s my disciple, after all.)
“…Usagi’s disciple?”
Hearing Master Usagi’s words, Ronus widened his eyes, while Jin took advantage of the opportunity to attack Master Usagi.
“It’s a good thing you have the guts to look the other way…!”
(I can win even if I’m looking elsewhere.)
“Huh! Can you say the same when you see this power?”
At that moment, a black mist overflows from Jin’s body, and he unleashes a powerful swing with his grass-cutting scythe at Master Usagi. However, Master Usagi calmly assessed the attack and delivered a kick to his temple, causing the attack to be deflected.
However, Jin had another grass-cutting scythe in his hand, which he swung to follow up. Master Usagi moved out of the way as a reaction to the first deflected blow. As I unintentionally followed his movements with my eyes, I received a reprimand from Master Usagi.
(Yuuya! If you have time to look at me, take him down quickly!)
“Ah!? Y-yes!”
When I hurriedly readied my spear again, Ronus was trembling tremendously.
“…You. Even though you are Usagi’s disciple, you don’t use his technique. Instead, you fight with a spear…?”
“Eh?”
I’m not just fighting him with a spear; I’m using it now because I can’t find an opening to attack Ronus with a kick. Also, it’s because it’s easier to take chances with [Absolute Spear] rather than with [Omni Sword], but it didn’t appear that way to Ronus.
“…Okay. I’ll show you the difference between us.”
Then, a black mist overflowed from Ronus’s body, and the intimidation from him increased. Kuro inside me laughed amusingly at the scene.
“Hey, hey, the opponent got serious, but… what are you going to do? Do you want to borrow the power of the Evil like before?”
“…No.”
“Hmm?”
“Even if I use the power of Evil here, the real Evil behind these opponents is still left. That’s why I have to defeat this former Holy, which uses the power of Evil, without relying on the power of Evil itself…!”
For a moment, Kuro seemed surprised by my words, but then he laughed out loud.
“Hahahahaha! That’s good! No, I can’t believe you could say that about a Holy… Well then, I guess I’ll just have to look at the bigger picture from another perspective.”
“All right!”
After rounding up the conversation with Kuro, I took a step back from Ronus and immediately switched my weapon to the [Formless Bow] and shot at Ronus from a distance.
“…Haaaahhhhh!”
“Seriously…”
The next moment Ronus emitted a kind of spirit like a shockwave which spread from his body, and all of my arrows were repelled.
“…Die!”
“Uh!?”
Just like Iris-san, he approached me with a speed that made me think that he had moved instantly, and then he thrust out his spear as if to gouge my stomach.
“…[Rising Dragon Piercing]!”
An illusion of a dragon seemed to fly out of the tip of the spear and tried to chew through my stomach. I had no choice but to block this attack that was released from a close distance; I switched from the [Formless Bow] to the [Omni Sword] and swung the sword down to meet the momentum head-on.
“Guuuuhhh!?”
The shock was transmitted through the sword to my entire body. I knew that I would be defeated at this point, but I suddenly felt my body heat up. It was as if the magic circuit inherited from Sage-san… was heating up as if to show me that it existed.
“Haaaaaaaahh!”
“What?”
While receiving Ronus’s attack, I prepared to unleash a spell, and when the spell became available, I unleashed the very first spell I had learned, a [Water Ball], at Ronus. It seems that he didn’t expect me to counterattack while blocking the attack, and Ronus hurriedly interrupted the attack and tried to distance himself.
However, without missing a beat, I took a step forward with all my might, using the leg strength I had developed during my training with Master Usagi. With all the momentum I could muster, I slammed a kick into Ronus’ stomach.
“Ohhhhh!”
“Guhoaaa!”
Ronus couldn’t block my kick, and he took some serious damage. He stayed in the sky for a moment with his body in a crooked shape. Although I tried to give chase afterward, Ronus clenched his teeth and forced himself into a stance to unleash another technique before I could follow up.
“…D-don’t mess with meeeeeeeee! [One Thousand Spear Piercing]!”
Ronus shot a barrage of raging thrusts at me again in the sky.
It’s dangerous… There’s no way to prevent it… The moment I despaired… Kuro, who had just said he would only watch, spoke to me in an amused tone.
“Hey, hey, it’s no good having you die here, you know? Take a good look at him. You should know what that means.”
“Take a good… look…?”
Although the tip of the spear was almost in front of me, I followed Kuro’s words and watched Ronus’s movements, the trajectory of his spear, and everything else. Then I found myself feeling as if the sounds and sights around me had been silenced. It was similar to the feeling I had when I watched the fighting tournament that had just taken place, but to a completely different level.
It was as if all unnecessary information were blocked out, and I could just see what was happening in front of me at a frighteningly slow pace as if my brain and body were absorbing all the information in front of me. I later found out that I was in the ultimate state of concentration at that time.
And as I watched Ronus’ movements, I naturally moved my body.
“───!”
“W-what was that?”
I also released the same technique that Ronus had used, the [One Thousand Spear Piercing]. The [One Thousand Spear Piercing] I released had countered Ronus’ [One Thousand Spear Piercing] one after another precisely.
“T-this is impossible! There is no way that my [Spear Holy Art] can be imitated…!”
Ronus shook his head to deny what was happening in front of his eyes and launched another technique.
“[Star Pile]!”
He grasped the spear in his opposite hand and swung it down at me as if it were a flag. When I saw the attack, I dodged it by rolling to the side and avoiding it, and Ronus’s spear stood on the ground.
It was enough to shake the arena and cause the ground to cave in. But I wasn’t even surprised by that; I just calmly looked at Ronus and attacked him with my [Absolute Spear].
“T-this is not how it’s supposed to be… This is definitely not how it’s supposed to be!”
When Ronus shouted that, he distanced himself from me with all his might and took a stance with his spear drawn back as hard as he could.
“Dieeeeeeeeeeeeee! [Divine Piercing]!”
I could tell at a glance that this was the most powerful attack he had ever made.
A whirlwind wrapped around the tip of his spear like the [Whirlwind Piercing] that he used before. This time it was so huge that it could be mistaken for a tornado, and the spear was coming at me so fast that it left everything behind.
This was why I also released it.
  ───The same technique as Ronus.
  “[Divine Piercing].”
“Ah…”
My move did not create a raging wind like Ronus’. The wind and space were unrecognizable. I thrust it at him.
The moment my [Absolute Spear] and Ronus’ spear collided… Ronus’ spear shattered.

Part 2
  The moment my [Absolute Spear] and Ronus’ spear collided… Ronus’ spear shattered.
“Gah───.”
Perhaps Ronus had put all of his energy into this last attack, but after his spear shattered, he fainted and quietly fell to the ground. While looking at this somewhat unrealistic scene, the sounds and sights of my surroundings gradually returned.
“…H-huh? Ro-Ronus?”
“What are you dumbfounded about? You beat him, didn’t you?”
Stunned by Kuro’s words, I turned my attention to Ronus, who had fallen to the ground.
I… defeated him? When did that happen?
“Could it be that the Evil power has gone out of control again?”
“It’s not that. Well, it’s not entirely unrelated… but you definitely defeated the Spear Saint lying there with your own hands.”
“What do you mean?”
“You may not remember, but your body remembers the feeling of the Evil when you defeated the Fist Saint. The only difference now is that you pulled the trigger for that power and defeated him.”
“Trigger…”
“That’s right. The power of Evil is a power that embraces everything. And maybe because you’ve activated it once, you’ve been able to control it subconsciously, albeit only partially. Well, even if you try to control it, you can only do so to the extent that it doesn’t go out of control.”
“Huh…?”
I’m not sure, but it seems that the reason I’ve been able to keep my Evil power from going out of control is not only because of Kuro’s power but also because of my subconscious.
“Thanks to your subconscious control of the power of Evil, you have been able to utilize it on a limited basis. That’s what’s happening with your eyes.”
“My eyes?”
I touched my eyes without thinking, and Kuro continued.
“Yeah. As I mentioned many times, the power of Evil is a power that embraces everything. It does not matter if it is tangible or intangible. It can even be used to strengthen and absorb techniques and movements…”
“That’s…”
I somehow understood what Kuro was trying to say and was astonished as I felt him smiling at me.
“[Evil Den’s Eye]… now you can absorb any movement with it.”
I was just dumbfounded by Kuro’s words. T-that kind of power…
However, the reason why this power was able to manifest itself was because I followed Kuro’s advice and watched Ronus’ movements. I stared at my hands without thinking, but then I remembered that I was still in combat.
“T-that’s right! Master Usagi is───.”
“It looks like he’s almost done there too, huh?”
“Eh?”
When I turned my attention to the battle between Master Usagi and the Scythe Saint Jin, I saw Jin bleeding.
“N-no way… We already have the power of Evil, and we’re still losing…!”
(Hmph. I was indeed defeated by the Fist Saint, who had the power of Evil. However, I polished my own power after that, without the power of Evil, and ended up defeating you like this. That’s all there is to it.)
“I-I won’t admit to it… I won’t admit that we who have acquired the power of Evil are losing!”
Jin shouted as he crossed the scythes in front of his face, and swung them out. Master Usagi took a leisurely stance against the cross-shaped slash that was unleashed from there.
([The Three Divine Steps])
And as he muttered this, Master Usagi disappeared from the spot.
“What?
(──The first step.)
It might seem as if Master Usagi had disappeared, but he just leaned forward and plunged into Jin when he took his first step. But that’s only because I was watching this from a distance. For Jin, who was actually receiving the technique, it would still look like he’d disappeared.
(Second step.)
Master Usagi then took advantage of his large first step and leaned forward some more. He rolled his body into a small ball from that position, and with a minimal rotation, dropped his second step over Jin’s head in a forward somersault.
“Gah───.”
The second step, delivered with tremendous force, was an extremely powerful heel drop that knocked Jin unconscious. Then, with a momentum from stomping on Jin, he spun in the air and landed. Master Usagi snickered.
(Hmph. I didn’t need to take the third step, after all, did I?)
Master, how much stronger can you get? I don’t think I can win against you…
I couldn’t help but feel that way about Master Usagi, who had defeated Jin. As I look at Master Usagi with my cheeks twitching, he turns to look at me.
(What are you dumbfounded about? The next one is the Evil.)
“T- that’s right! Iris-san is───.”
Just as I was about to say that much, I heard the tense voice of Quarro from above.
“Arere? The two of them have already been defeated? They are so useless.”
“Wha-?”
When I turned my gaze to the sky above, I saw the figure of Quarro, who had black mist spewing from his body and was freely moving it to attack Iris-san.
“Kuh…!”
(…This is not good.)
The black mist spewing from Quarro’s body became countless sharp blades and poured down on Iris-san. Iris-san was desperately trying to deal with it with her sword. However, it seemed that she couldn’t handle all of them and was in a difficult position as it appears.
“Iris-san! M-master!”
(Yeah. We’re coming too…!)
While Master Usagi charged straight at Quarro, I took out my [Formless Bow] and fired a large number of arrows.
But…
“Too bad. That won’t reach me.”
Before the arrows could reach Quarro, they were all blocked by the black mist overflowing from Quarro’s body.
“I’m not sure why, but you have a piece of us in you. Did one of us give you that power? If so, I should have at least heard about it, and more importantly, it’s weird that you’re fighting against me! What’s going on?”
I’m not going to say anything, but instead I’m going to keep shooting arrows at him. They were also easily blocked by Quarro’s black mist, but Master Usagi took advantage of the gap to close in on Quarro.
(How about this…!)
Master Usagi closed in on Quarro with speed I’ve never seen before and unleashed a kick at Quarro that makes the space roar.
I see! Because Quarro was a pure Evil, Master Usagi’s stats had been released and doubled, so he’s even more powerful than usual. As I was thinking this, Kuro inside me answered in a stern voice.
“…No good.”
“Eh?”
“You don’t even realize it, do you? If the Kicking Saint’s stats can be released, then, of course, the Sword Saint stats should be released as well. That’s what it is all…”
I heard Quarro’s amused voice interrupting Kuro’s words.
“As I said… you won’t reach me.”
(Wha… agaaahh!)
The black mist easily caught Master Usagi’s kick, and as the black mist drifting around approached Master Usagi, it transformed into a sharp blade that went straight through him.
“M-Master Usagi!”
(I-I’m fine! Just stay away from me!)
“Eh?”
Master Usagi said to me as he stepped away from me, holding his slashed stomach.
(…If you get too close to me, you will fall prey to the power of that Evil. It’s a surprise attack from one side, but if you came closer, you would have been surrounded and killed.)
“N-no way…”
(You should continue to attack from a distance with your magic or bow from there. Iris and I will somehow take advantage of the gap and launch a counterattack…!)
“Wait… Master!”
Master Usagi said only that and then went back to fighting with Quarro again. As for me, as Master Usagi directed, I fired arrows and magic from a long distance, but all of them were blocked by Quarro’s black mist.
Isn’t that black mist too versatile? How are we supposed to attack him…!
As I grew increasingly impatient, both Master Usagi and Iris-san received more and more attacks, and they were gradually pushed back.
Then, Quarro stretched out his hand and sighed boringly.
“Fuwahh… what a letdown. I’ve been told that Sword Saint is the strongest of the Holy, and I’ve also been told that Kicking Saint is also one of the strongest, and yet you’re not strong at all. The two people I brought with me were also defeated. It would have been better if I had come alone.”
Quarro then stretched out and gave the two of them a cold stare.
“I’m bored, so let’s end this ── now.”
“Usagiii!”
(I know…!)
As the black mist overflowing from Quarro’s body suddenly thickened and increased in volume, the mist gradually gathered above Quarro’s head to form a sphere. It gradually grew larger and larger, giving the impression that it would destroy everything… which was terrifying.
Even though I wasn’t looking at it up close, my instincts were screaming facing the sphere.
That thing is… dangerous…!
Then Kuro, who was also inside me, said in a cold voice.
“…He’s really going to finish them off. If that thing goes off as is… this city will be wiped out.”
“No way!”
Anyway, I shot arrows, threw the [Absolute Spear], and attacked as much as I could, but all of them were completely blocked.
And…
“See you later.”
At last, the black sphere was released at us.

ED: Blast
Part 3
  At last, the black sphere was released aiming at us.
“[Holy Sword Barrier]!”
([Holy Kicking Wave]! [Holy Ear Impact]!)
Immediately after the black sphere was released, Iris-san raised the sword in her hand and thrust it vigorously into the ground. Then, countless shining swords appeared from the ground and shot towards the black sphere.
Master Usagi also produced the same light as Iris-san’s sword from his leg and shot it at the black sphere, followed by a flash of light from both of his ears.
The two lights from Iris-san’s sword and Master Usagi collided with the black sphere.
“Kuh… Hahahahaha!”
“!”
And then, Iris-san’s shining swords and Master Usagi’s light rays obliterated the black sphere!
“Hah… hah…”
(Kuh… my body is…)
However, both Iris-san and Master Usagi were exhausted after that exchange. They no longer seemed to be able to move properly. Then Quarro opened his mouth, looking slightly surprised.
“Wow… I didn’t think that only the two of you could prevent this… I’m not sure if this means I’m the weak one here, or would it be you, the Holy ones?”
“Hah… hah…”
“But it seems that stopping that was all you could do. …So, let’s try it one more time♪.”
“What-!?”
Quarro said that he would repeat his attack, and a black sphere formed over his head again.
“Ahahahahaha! Look, look! You have to defend against it once more!”
“Iris-san! Master Usagi! Kuh!”
No longer following Master Usagi’s words, I immediately ran out and attacked Quarro with my [Omni-Sword] in hand. But before I could reach him, the black mist blocked my way.
“Get out of my way!”
“It’s no use. You’re not even a Holy; you wouldn’t be able to even damage it, you know?”
As Quarro said, no matter how I attacked, the black mist didn’t seem to take any damage and swarmed at me one after another. In addition, Quarro mercilessly directed the black mist at the tired and immobile Master Usagi and Iris-san.
Master Usagi and Iris-san responded with all their strength, but they were on the defensive and looked like they were struggling.
Kuro, who had been watching from inside me, opened his mouth.
“It is exactly what he said. The only ones who can defeat the Evil itself are those of the Holy who are recognized by this planet. Just give up.”
“So what am I supposed to do?”
I shouted while desperately using my [Omni-Sword] and [Absolute Spear] to get rid of the black mist, and Kuro replied disinterestedly.
“That’s right… I can only think of using a weapon that has the power of the Holy in it.”
“A weapon with the power of the Holy?”
“When you first encountered the Evil Beast in the other world, the woman who was with you used a talisman to kill it, right? That was definitely one way to purge the power of Evil. Well, I don’t think you have one of those, though.”
“…No, I do have it. I’m sure it was…!”
“What?”
Kuro seemed to have given up, but I searched desperately in my item box while dealing with the black mist. It appeared that this situation could be overcome… by the use of a weapon with a similar effect to the one used by Kagurazaka-san.
As I searched for it desperately, Quarro stared amusedly at the black sphere floating above his head.
“Look, look, it’s almost finished!”
“It’s a real pity, but you should give up. You’ve done your best there, haven’t you?”
“Kuh!”
I ignored Quarro’s and Kuro’s words and continued my search… and found it.
“This is it!”
“Hmm?”
“Yu… Yuuya-kun…?”
While the eyes of Quarro and the wounded Iris-san were focused on me, I had a weapon in my hand.
Then…
“[Heavenly Khakkhara]!”
When I first saw the effects of this weapon, I didn’t understand what it meant. The description was so vague that there was not a single detailed explanation. But now, I can understand the effect of this weapon properly.
I hit the black mist with the khakkhara in my hand while ringing the golden ring.
“As I said, it’s usele──.”
Quarro was about to say that much when he noticed something strange. The black mist that I struck dissipated in an instant.
“What-…”
As expected, this phenomenon was unexpected, and Quarro rounded his eyes. There was only one effect on this [Heavenly Khakkhara], which I had found in my grandfather’s warehouse. To exorcise. That’s all.
…Thinking about it now, the only explanation for the effect was that it’s a somewhat mysterious weapon, but if it has the power to exorcise, then it will affect the power of Evil… just like the talisman at the time, and that was my train of thought. But the results were just right.
I smashed all the black mists that surrounded me with the [Heavenly Khakkhara] and rushed straight to Iris-san and Master Usagi, and the black mists that assaulted them also dissipated.
“Are the two of you okay?”
(Yeah…)
“…..”
Then, although Master Usagi’s voice came back, there was no reply from Iris-san, so I hurriedly checked and found Iris-san staring at me with a dazed expression.
“Iris-san?”
“Huh? Ah… y-yeah! I’m fine.”
“Good, then. I’ll take care of the rest… so please keep an eye on it.”
I told her that and turned to Quarro again.
“…..”
(Hmm… it seems like you can’t afford to not fall in love in this situation, huh?)
“Wha… T-that’s not true! I-it was just that someone was protecting me… um… it was the first time for me…”
(Hmm… Well, now you know how outrageous my disciple is.)
“…Yes. I understand.”
It seemed that they were talking about something behind me, but I didn’t have time to listen in on it because I had already returned my full attention to Quarro. Anyway, I looked at Quarro and called out to Kuro, who was inside me.
“What do you think? Does this work?”
“…Hahaha! You’re a hell of a guy; you know that? No problem, I’ll lend you a hand!”
Kuro laughed in amusement, and a black mist flooded my body.
“…I’d like to ask you a question, can Kuro’s power, which was just a piece of Evil, defeat the main body of Evil?”
“Hah! I’ll lend you a hand. It’s not about whether or not you could possibly win; it’s all about winning.”
“That’s just crazy…”
“…Well, you and I are a good match after all. We can do it.”
“Is that so?”
I smiled unconsciously at Kuro, who sounded somewhat embarrassed as he spoke.
Iris-san, who was behind me, raised an anxious voice at my appearance.
“What-… The power of Evil? Usagi, you…!”
(Calm down. I know what you’re going to ask, but Yuuya is sane. For some reason, he has the power of Evil in his body, but it’s not a problem.)
“Not a problem, you say…? What kind of reason would he have to have that power?”
(Originally, that power didn’t belong to Yuuya but a disciple of the Bow Saint had it in her body. However, Yuuya took over that power, and now it’s residing in his body.)
“T-took it over, you say…?”
(…He’s really a big idiot, after all.)
Quarro was even more surprised and froze at the sight of the Evil overflowing from my body.
“Wait… what does this mean? It’s just supposed to be a piece inside you… but its power is the same as mine no matter how I look at it… What the hell are you?”
I didn’t answer his question.
Then, my lack of response seemed to annoy him as Quarro twisted his face in displeasure.
“You have the nerve to ignore me, don’t you? ──Go.”
“──Gigiiiiiiii!”
When Quarro hurriedly waved his arm, a black mist spread about, and several Evil Beasts appeared and attacked me.
“This is…!”
*Kiiiiiiin*
Just as I was about to dispose of the Evil Beast that was attacking me, that clear metallic sound reached my ears.
“G-gi..!”
The Evil Beasts that tried to attack me all fell to the ground.
Involuntarily I turned my gaze to Iris-san who was behind me and she smiled fiercely in response.
“…There are many questions that I want to ask you, but leave the Evil Beasts to me. Therefore… I’m asking you to take care of him, okay?”
“…Yes!”
I nodded vigorously at Iris-san’s words and called out to Kuro.
“…Are you ready?”
“Yeah, leave it to me. But, it won’t last long. Your power is too strong, after all…”
“That’s just fine!”
In addition to releasing the Evil’s power, I also deployed my [Magic Attire] and took a step toward Quarro. At that moment, the surrounding scenery was left behind in an instant, and the figure of Quarro was right in front of me.
“Wha──.”
“Haaaaah!”
“Gaaah!”
I waved the [Heavenly Khakkhara] similar way to how I handle the [Absolute Spear] and slammed it onto Quarro’s head. Then, Quarro, who could not react to the attack, was slammed into the ground.
In that gap, I pierced the black sphere that was accumulating above his head with the [Heavenly Khakkhara]. The black sphere pierced by the [Heavenly Khakkhara] gradually cracked, and light overflowed from it as it burst.
“No way… What the hell are you?”
Quarro, who was slammed into the ground, shouted as he staggered around in a dizzy state…
“I don’t know!”
“What?”
Quarro was astonished by my answer.
I’ve been asked that question a lot today, but there’s no way I know who I am. I’d rather be the one asking. All I could say was that I somehow got caught up in this battle between Evil and Holy, and I had to become stronger to feel safe. But it seemed that Quarro was not satisfied with my answer, and his face turned red with anger.
“St… stop messing around! You come out of nowhere and interrupt my fun… I’ll kill you!”
As Quarro spewed a large amount of black mist from his body, they branched out into countless pieces and stabbed at me as sharp blades. While knocking them away with the [Heavenly Khakkhara], I gradually closed the distance between us.
“Don’t come, don’t come, don’t coooooome!”
“!”
In the midst of his raging attacks, Quarro turned his palm toward me, and a small black sphere appeared, shooting a black flash of light at me. In response to the black flash, I took a step forward, keeping in mind the final attack Master Usagi had used against the Scythe Saint.
My body moved even faster than before, and the distance separating me and the black flash was already almost gone. In such a situation, I use the [Heavenly Khakkhara] to unleash the [Divine Piercing] still used by the Spear Saint Ronus.
“[Divine Piercing]…!”
    The tip of the [Heavenly Khakkhara] pierced through the black flashes of light and finally struck Quarro’s body.
“Gaaaah!”
Quarro’s body was bent into a crooked shape, and his voice leaked out in anguish.
“No way… This is not how it’s supposed to be…!”
Then, perhaps the effect of the [Heavenly Khakkhara] was activated, smoke rose from Quarro’s body.
“This me is going to be destroyed! This is a lie… This is impossible…”
Quarro desperately grasped the handle of the [Heavenly Khakkhara], trying to escape from my thrust, but the smoke was even coming from his palms touching it, and he could not escape. Eventually, as the amount of smoke increased, and Quarro’s body gradually began to disappear, he suddenly stopped resisting and spoke in a quiet tone, as if his resistance just a moment ago had been a lie.
“Hah… so this is really the end for me. It’s a pretty anticlimactic ending, but… well, that’s about it. It seems that the Evil Beasts have been defeated as well, and we’ve lost. I thought I could have more fun playing around.”
Quarro said with deep regret and then turned a sharp look at me.
“…I didn’t expect such an uncertain factor to be mixed in. It’s out of my calculation.”
“…..”
“But well… now that we know about you, right?”
“?”
I tilted my head, not understanding the meaning of Quarro’s words. However, Quarro did not show any sign of answering and now looked at Master Usagi and Iris-san.
“I don’t know how much you know about us, but… we are one.”
“Eh?”
(…What?)
Iris-san and Master Usagi did not seem to understand the meaning of Quarro’s words. They looked at him with a dubious expression while he looked at them with amusement.
“Well then, try to do your best~.”
And then, as Quarro’s body completely disintegrated, the smoke finally dissipated.
  ＊＊＊
  “───Quarro is gone?”
The young man Evil muttered quietly in the “World’s Disposal Ground.” Then, he gazed at the palm of his hand as if to confirm his own power.
“Fumu… I see. So it’s integrated in this way.”
“───What are you going to do?”
The other Evil in the place quietly asked the young man. The other Evil is a somewhat nervous-looking man who looks to be in his thirties.
“It’s a pity that Quarro is gone, but there was also… the harvest.”
“Is that an enhancement for you?”
“Fuh… it’s that, but it’s also something different.”
“Then what?”
In response to the man’s question, the young man’s eyes narrowed as if he were gazing into some distant presence.
“I found it ── the outsider.”
In the eyes of the young man, the image of Yuuya, who defeated Quarro, is clearly visible.
  ＊＊＊
  By the time Yuuya had defeated Quarro, the Evil Beast summoned by Quarro had been defeated by Night and the others with the Regal Kingdom soldiers.
“Phew… I wondered what it was when it suddenly appeared… but I guess these are the Evil familiars…”
Luna murmured in front of the dead bodies of the defeated Evil Beasts. The Evil Beast that Yuuya and Kagurazaka defeated in the Earth was purified by Kagurazaka’s talisman and disappeared cleanly, but the many corpses of the Evil Beast remained in this place now.
In response to Luna, Lexia, who had been keeping quiet, puffed out her chest with pride.
“As expected of my guard!”
“Hmm… Well. More importantly, how’s Yuuya…”
While saying this, she looked towards Yuuya and saw Quarro just disappearing.
“…It looks like everything went well over there, too. This time, that Yuuya saved the country from a crisis… For the Regal Kingdom, Yuuya must be considered a hero.”
“Aaahh Geez! Yuuya-sama was fighting so splendidly against the Sword Saint in the first place!”
“…You really can’t be shaken, can you?”
Everyone was stunned and speechless by the earlier battle between the Sword Saint Iris and Yuuya up until the Evil attacked. For the Regal citizens, everyone knew that Iris, the Sword Saint, was strong. Still, the sight of Yuuya fighting on equal footing with her was a shock not only to the Regal citizens but also to Orghis and the others here.
In the meantime, when the Evil attacked and interrupted the battle between Iris and Yuuya while unleashing a large number of Evil Beasts into the arena, the entire venue was in an uproar, but the situation ended more easily than expected.
The reason for this is…
“Finished. No sign of the Evil Beast anywhere.”
“Woof.”
For Lexia and the others, the still mysterious Yuti, and Yuuya’s partner, Night, have defeated almost all the Evil Beasts. And although Akatsuki didn’t take part in the battle itself, he was also very active, using his skills to heal injured civilians and soldiers.
“Night, Akatsuki. Thank you for saving my life.”
“Woof~.”
“Fugofugo.”
Luna patted them, Night seemed to feel good, and Akatsuki looked like he deserved it and was proud of it.
“Even so… he was really just sleeping…”
While Luna stroked Night and Akatsuki, she looked at the still sleeping Ouma with a dumbfounded look.
Then, Ouma opened one eye.
“What is it? You seem to have a problem with that?”
“You’re awake?”
“I just woke up.”
Ouma made a big yawn as he said that and then turned his gaze to Luna.
“I told you already. I am not interested in the affairs of humans. I’m not going to help.”
“…I see.”
Luna couldn’t continue conversing with Ouma any longer. As Ouma said, as a legendary dragon he is not concerned with the circumstances of human beings; Luna also knew that. Even if there are people who are dissatisfied with the way it is, they cannot be bothered with it because Ouma has the power to wipe out even that… or even the planet itself.
Luna breathed a sigh of relief at having gotten through this situation, but then she noticed something.
“Hmm? Speaking of which… where is the royal family of the Regal Kingdom?”
“Huh? Sure, I haven’t seen them… I even remember when they went to give orders to the soldiers, but…”
Although she looked around the entire arena, she couldn’t see Orghis and the others, so Luna and the others thought that they had gone to give instructions outside the arena.
In the middle of all this, Ouma sighed again and turned his attention to the sky above the arena.
“…Hmm. Scout magic, huh? It won’t work on me, but… Yuuya. You’ve finally been discovered, eh?”
Ouma said, laughing merrily, and fell asleep again.

Here’s the sponsored epilogue by Patreon, enjoy~
ED: Blast
Epilogue
  When Quarro attacked, immediately after Orghis gave instructions to his soldiers, he went to the summoning magic circle in the basement of the castle together with Layla.
“…No way, the Evil is attacking us today…!”
“Father…”
Layla looked worried as Orghis frowned. Then Orghis noticed her gaze and exhaled slowly.
“Fuh… it’s unavoidable. For the time being, I’ve left the soldiers to Royle. We… have no choice but to rely on the other world.”
Orghis saw the match between the Sword Saint and Yuuya and was impressed by how strong they were, and almost thought that there was no need to rely on the other world to counter the Evil. However, when he saw the Evil that had arrived, he immediately changed his mind.
He saw that the Sword Saint, who was supposed to be the strongest Holy, was being overwhelmed by Quarro. Convinced that the country would be destroyed by the Evil if things had continued as they were, Orghis immediately began to move. Even if they were able to defeat Quarro, he did not think that this was enough to eliminate all of the Evil.
This was why he finally made up his mind to summon a hero from another world.
When he moved to the summoning room, there were the magicians of the Regal Kingdom. They had already completed the magic circle under his direction.
“Your Majesty. The preparations are in place. We just need to pour in the magic power, and the magic will be activated.”
“…Layla.”
“Yes, father. I will bring a hero or a saint into this world. I’m sure that person will be able to save this world.”
Prompted by Orghis, Layla stepped forward and touched the magic circle with her hand. When the magic power was poured in from her hand, the magic circle began to glow mysteriously.
“Kuh. T-this is…”
At first, Layla was pouring in the magic power smoothly, but gradually the magic circle began to suck the magic power from Layla, and she frowned at the amount of absorption. The magic circle shone brighter and brighter as it tried to suck up all of Layla’s magic power at a tremendous rate.
How much time had passed?
Layla, whose face was pale from her magic power being drained, could not tell, but when her magic power was about to run out… it finally stopped.
“Ah…”
“Layla!”
Orghis hurriedly supported Layla, who was wobbling and about to fall. Then, the shine of the magic circle reached its brightest in front of the two of them, and the light finally burst out.
“Ugh!”
“F-finally…!”
When the light subsided, there was a single figure floating in the air. Seeing that, Orghis and the others knew that the summoning magic had succeeded.
And then──.
  “──W-what is this? What on earth is going on?”
  What appeared from the magic circle was a girl in a shrine maiden costume ── Mai Kagurazaka.
  ＊＊＊
  “Hmm… for that reason…”
After I finished defeating Quarro, I was interrogated by Iris-san about how I acquired Evil’s power since I had activated it in front of her.
“It really was just like Usagi said, wasn’t it?”
(That’s what I told you. Why don’t you believe me?)
“How can I believe you from such a tall tale?”
(Well, he’s just a big idiot, isn’t he?)
“Ugh…”
I shrunk under the stunned gazes of Iris-san and Master Usagi. Then, Kuro, who was inside me, burst into laughter.
“Ahahahaha! You’re so weak that it’s hard to believe you were fighting with the Evil until just now!”
“I-it can’t be helped, can it?”
Because Quarro had to be defeated, I fought with him. Otherwise, I would have been killed. And I wasn’t that strong to begin with.
Iris-san turned a dumbfounded gaze at me, but after letting out a single sigh, she let out a bitter laugh.
“…Well, it’s true that Yuuya-kun saved my life. I-I was protected. I’ve never had such a thing happen to me before… Well, I mean, I was happy about it… or something like that…”
“Eh?”
(Sigh…)
The latter half of the words were too small to be heard, but Master Usagi let out a sigh to Iris-san. After that, he immediately returned to his serious expression and stared at me.
(Yuuya. You must have understood the threat of Evil from this incident. In addition, he left behind a few mysteries that we don’t know about yet… We can’t let our guard down.)
“…Yes.”
(And then. The next time, I will increase the intensity of my training so that we can prepare for another attack at any time.)
“Ugh… I understand…”
I would be happier if I could just relax and enjoy my time, but I can’t say that, so I nodded to Master Usagi’s words. For some reason, Iris-san, who was gazing enviously at the exchange between Master Usagi and me, laughed a little sadly.
“I see… So this is where I have to part ways with you, Yuuya-kun…”
“Ah… that’s right.”
“What do you plan to do now?”
“Well, as Master Usagi said earlier, I guess I’ll train.”
It seems that the training was going to be tough. Will I be able to stay safe? I…
“I finally met someone who’s stronger than me…”
“Eh?”
With a sad expression, Iris-san muttered something, but I couldn’t hear her. Then Iris-san looked up, suddenly realizing something, and her eyes lit up.
“Yes, that’s it!”
“W-what’s wrong?”
The tension was so high that I was slightly pressured to ask.
“Yuuya-kun! I’ll make you my disciple too!”
“…Huh?”
(Hou?)
For some reason, Master Usagi nodded in admiration while I looked puzzled at Iris-san’s words.
(That’s good. My technique is not enough for you. You should train with Iris for a while.)
“Ueeeee? W-wait! Even if you suddenly say something like that!”
“It’s okay, it’s okay! Please don’t be shy; leave it all to this Onee-san! …You’re already stronger than me. If we continue to deepen our relationship as master and disciple, we can get married! I’m a genius!”
“U-um, Iris-san?”
“Now that we’ve decided, let’s start training right away!”
“Eeeeeeehhh! N-now? We just finished fighting!”
“That’s why!”
Iris-san’s words made my face turn pale.
S-seriously… the training with Master Usagi was going to be more severe from now on, and now I also have to add the training with Iris-san…?
Will my stamina really be enough?
When I had such a question in my mind, Iris-san and Master Usagi suddenly turned their gazes sharply towards the castle.
“What’s wrong?”
“…There’s an incredible amount of magic power just now…”
(Did you feel it too, Iris…? What the heck is that magic power…?)
It seems that they felt a great magic power from the castle, and they have a stern expression on their faces.
  ──However, at this time, I did not think that what was happening in the castle of the Regal Kingdom would be directly related to me at all.

ED: Blast
Afterword
  Thank you for taking a look at this work.
I’m Miku, the author.
I hope everyone is doing well. As for me, I’m in good health. I hope you enjoyed this story as a way to pass the time.
As for the story of this volume, Yuuya is once again very busy with the battle against the Sword Saint and the Evil’s main body.
In addition, in the real world, the other world’s influence has started to spread to the Earth, such as meeting the Evil Beast at the place where Kaori and the others went to test their courage.
On the other hand, in the other world, in the Regal Kingdom, a ritual of summoning a holy maiden was held in order to fight against Evil. As a result, the holy shrine maiden Mai Kagurazaka, who had been living on Earth, was summoned to the other world… What will happen now?
It’s a mystery to me as well. So I hope you’ll look forward to the next volume with me.
Now, I’d like to thank my editor-in-charge-sama for his cooperation again. I would like to thank Reine Kuwashima-sama for the cool illustrations that made this work so wonderful. I would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all the readers who have picked up this book and enjoyed it.
Thank you very much.
See you soon.
Miku.

Here’s the 7th volume’s prologue, I hope you can enjoy this volume as well~
ED: Blast
Prologue
  The world’s negative energy is swirling. The ground is withering, and it is impossible for living things to survive in the farthest reaches of the… [World’s Disposal Ground].
A while after Yuuya’s existence became known to the Evil, the Evil with the form of a young man summoned the group again.
“…It’s unusual for us to be summoned this often.”
A nervous-looking Evil, who had arrived a step ahead of the others, muttered quietly.
“But will the others come? They didn’t even respond to the previous call…”
“──You don’t need to worry about them; it’s all good.”
“!”
When he heard a new voice, the nervous-looking Evil turned around and saw the young-looking Evil there. However, the nervous-looking Evil noticed that there was something a little strange about him.
It was similar to the change that occurred immediately after the death of the recently deceased Evil with the form of a boy ─ Quarro.
“This is… what does this mean? You seem to have gotten much stronger in a little while I haven’t seen you …”
The nervous-looking Evil was overwhelmed by the presence of the young-looking Evil. It’s to the extent that the quality of the power emitting from the young man seemed to have improved over the years.
So, the nervous-looking Evil came up with a thought.
“Could it be that you killed the others?”
There had been several gatherings of the Evil at this World’s Disposal Ground, but the only ones who gathered previously were the young man Evil, the nervous-looking Evil, and the now-deceased Quarro. However, there was no way that the three of them were the only Evil that existed in the world as a manifestation of the negative energy. There were Evil all over the world, and each of them spent their time as they pleased.
This was why nervous-looking Evil thought those Evils had been killed without his knowledge.
But…
“Yeah, those guys ─ I killed them all.”
“What─.”
The young man’s words, which he had not expected, rendered the nervous-looking Evil speechless.
“Y-you killed them, you said? …What are you thinking about? Quarro had been eliminated, and our strength is now reduced. And yet…!”
“I’ve realized something.”
“What?”
“No matter how we attack them individually as we are now, we will only lose like Quarro. That’s why we need absolute power – not as a group, but as individuals.”
The young man’s Evil did not seem to be particularly concerned about the nervous-looking Evil reaction and told him plainly.
“And now that Quarro is dead, his power has been passed to me. But that’s not enough. The person who killed Quarro is an existence that we never expected. That’s why it will take an overwhelming power to kill him and lay waste to the humans, including the Holy. Rather than gathering together like the weak, it would be better to have a single, overwhelmingly powerful person to overrun them. So I thought to myself. I’m going to be that one person, and I’m going to destroy everything.”
“No way…?”
“Yeah, you’ve guessed it. I killed all the others, and they became part of me. You’re the only one left.”
“Kuh!”
The nervous-looking Evil instantly distanced himself from the young-looking Evil. He gathered up the black mist, transformed it into a huge spear, and unleashed it directly at the young man.
Facing the massive black spear approaching with terrifying speed and power, the young man Evil did not even show any pretense of avoiding it. At the moment the spear touched him… the spear reverted into a black mist and dispersed.
“R-ridiculous!”
“The quality of my evil power is far superior to yours. Your attack would not leave a single scratch.”
When he heard the young man’s words, the nervous-looking Evil, thinking that he had a slim chance of winning, immediately gathered up the black mist to tried to flee from the place.
However…
“What?”
The black mist that the nervous-looking Evil desperately gathered up had dissipated again, and in contrast, it gathered around the young-looking Evil.
“I told you already. The quality of my evil power is vastly superior to yours… which means that all the negative power in the world has gathered around me. There is not a single evil power you can control anymore.”
“N-no way…”
Before this unreasonable power, the nervous-looking Evil was at a loss for words, and the young man smiled.
“But, it’s painful for me too to just kill you after we’ve been through so much together. That’s why… I’ll show you the true power of my ultimate perfected Evil.”
“Ah──.”
The dense black mist hovering around the young man’s Evil suddenly wriggled and transformed itself into the shape of a hand. Eventually multiple hands appeared as if they were growing out of the back of the young man’s Evil. Furthermore, these hands formed by the black mist were holding a variety of weapons.
And when he saw the variety of weapons, the nervous-looking Evil noticed something and opened his eyes.
“T-those weapons are… the weapons of the Fallen Saints…!?”
“That’s right. I killed the other Evil as well as the Fallen Saints, and this was an unexpected harvest… As you can see, I’ve even acquired all the skills of the Fallen Saints.”
Originally, each and every individual Evil was already overwhelmingly powerful. In order to counter them, the human race up until now had managed to combat the Evil by acquiring the title of Holy for those who have mastered the skills in various fields.
However, the young-looking Evil was not only powerful as an Evil, but he had also acquired the skills that the Holy had acquired and was becoming a more perfect being.
“Now, I’ll take care of the rest. You can disappear in peace.”
“C-curse yooouuuuuu!”
The nervous-looking Evil was releasing the faint remaining Evil power desperately. And at the same time, the jet black spear that the young man unleashed had pierced through the nervous-looking Evil with ease.
“Gahaahhh…”
The nervous-looking Evil had been pierced in the stomach and could no longer move properly glared at the young-looking Evil with eyes filled with tremendous murderous intent.
“Y-you bastard… to do something like this to me…!”
“It’s become tedious. Just shut up and become my food.”
At that moment, a black mist gathered around the feet of the nervous-looking Evil. The mist took on the shape of some kind of jaw ─ and ate the nervous-looking Evil.
“Gyaaaaaaaaaaahh!”
The sound of ripping flesh, shattering bones, along with the scream of the nervous-looking Evil was heard as he was being chewed. In the end, when the sound disappeared and the black mist dispersed, the young man noticed something unusual with his body.
“Ugh! O-oooohhh!”
The negative power surrounding the World’s Disposal Ground was gathering around the young man. In addition, new energies that were still created by the negative emotions around the world were also flowing into the young-looking Evil.
The energy turned into a jet-black sphere that completely enveloped the Evil. Eventually, the jet-black sphere cracked, and the young man appeared from within.
He had long jet-black hair that seemed to consume everything and black eyes that looked like bottomless holes. The power of the Evil, concentrated to the utmost limit, was leaking out of his body in a faint aura. The young man looked down at his reborn body and stared at his hands.
“…Ah, I was right after all.”
When the young man gathers the power of Evil in his right palm, a jet-black sphere the size of a marble emerges.
    The moment he randomly threw it in front of him, a thunderous roar echoed throughout the World’s Disposal Ground.
“…Hmm. Is the power still not completely accustomed to my new body…?”
The young man’s Evil glared at the distant sky and laughed ferociously.
“Just wait, you outsider. I’m going to wipe you out without a trace. For the first step… I will go to the country where Quarro was killed to say hello──.”
After evolving into the ultimate perfect form, the “God of Destruction” ─ Avis disappeared as if melting into the world.

Chapter 1 – Sweet Practice
Part 1
  ──It’s been a few days since I defeated Quarro, one of the Evil. As Master Usagi had said, my training had become more severe than before.
“──[One Thousand Spear Piercing]!”
(Hmph.)
I transformed to the Evil and unleashed the Spear Saint technique that I had acquired during the battle with the Fallen Saint.
I had awakened a new power during that battle… Thanks to the [Evil Den’s Eye], I was able to use some of the Spear Saint’s technique. But neither the [Evil Den’s Eye] nor the Spear Saint technique were reflected in my status. It seemed that I had acquired them as my own unique skills.
With my new skills, countless spear attacks were directed at Master Usagi. However, Master Usagi didn’t seem to be overwhelmed by the number of attacks and just brushed them off with his legs.
“S-seriously?”
(Do you think that your attacks which aren’t equipped with the [Magic Attire] would hit me? Here, do not let your mind wander…!)
“Whoa!”
After Master Usagi parried away my attack lightly, he accelerated straight at me and mercilessly directed a kick at my face. I managed to avoid it by turning my upper body. Then I countered by kicking Master Usagi while upside down.
“Oh?”
Master Usagi seemed a little impressed by my action, but he casually used my kick as a foothold and moved away from me.
(You used to be too preoccupied to avoid it, but now you’re fighting back… It looks like you’re growing up, at least.)
“I-I wonder if that’s true…”
I’m not confident at all.
After all, my attacks were all deflected, so I didn’t feel like I was growing up at all.
I know that if I don’t use [Magic Attire], I won’t be able to land an attack, but this training also has the purpose of raising my natural strength, so I didn’t use it on purpose.
(Well, that’s fine. But if you only attack with your spear and kicks, it won’t be any different than before, right?)
“…I know that.”
I put away my [Absolute Spear] and took out my [Omni-Sword].
And then──.
“[Single Sword Flash]!”
(!)
By applying the kicking technique that was handed down by Master Usagi to attack, I was able to approach Master Usagi with tremendous momentum, and then I was able to swing the whole sword that was in my hand to the side.
This technique was a Sword Saint technique which was taught by Iris-san. The strike contained my full power, and for the first time in today’s training, Master Usagi took evasive actions instead of just brushing aside my attack.
But my attack was not over yet.
“───[Heavenly Rotation]!”
(What?)
One of the Sword Saint techniques was the [Heavenly Rotation], which was an attack that launches a tornado of slashes by slashing the sword upward from the bottom. I learned this technique from Iris-san, but I am not yet able to create a tornado as large as hers.
Even so, if I unleashed it at close range, even Master Usagi wouldn’t be able to avoid it.
(Hmph… interesting…!)
“Huh?”
However, facing my new technique, Master Usagi smiled ferociously, which was completely uncharacteristic of a rabbit, and he dispelled the oncoming tornado of slashes with his foot.
(Unfortunately, you’re not quite there yet.)
“I guess…?”
(Mmm?)
Master Usagi thought my attack was over, but my focus was on my next attack. This was one of the most powerful techniques that Iris-san taught me.
It is───.
“[Heavenly Saint Slash]──!”
While Master Usagi dealt with the tornado of slashes I’ve unleashed, I adjusted my stance and took a big step forward as I did with the [Single Sword Flash].
The preliminary movement of the attack was so large that if I were to unleash it normally, Master Usagi would have easily avoided it. But right now, Master Usagi was in the middle of dealing with another of my techniques. There was no way he could prevent it.
“Haaaaaaah!”
As I stepped forward with all my might, I poured my magic power into the [Omni-Sword], causing it to glow pale blue and it transformed into a giant light sword. The light sword was swung down with great force at Master Usagi.
(Kuhahahahaha! That’s good, that’s good! [Breaking Flash Kick]!)
However, Master Usagi, who had managed to deal with the tornado of slashes that I had unleashed, pulled his foot back to the extreme and then released it in one fell swoop to unleash a kick.
The power of the kick was so great that it pierced the slash of extreme magical power that I had unleashed! It was as if he had focused all his strength to break through at a single point, and his technique easily surpassed the results of my training.
I’m not a true Holy, so I used the magic power I inherited from Sage-san as a substitute. However, the power was close to that of the actual [Heavenly Saint Slash]… and even my full power version of the [Heavenly Saint Slash] still could not reach Master Usagi in the end.
“Am I really growing up…?”
A weak voice unintentionally leaked out of my mouth, but please forgive me. As I was sighing heavily, Master Usagi broke through my [Heavenly Saint Slash]; he kept his distance and released his fighting stance.
(Hmm, do you want to leave it at that for today? Even so, being able to easily absorb not only my technique but also the Sword Saint technique makes me more and more curious about what you are.)
“A-ahahaha…”
“──It looks like it’s over.”
A female voice called out to me after I finished my training with Master Usagi. When I turned my gaze towards the voice, I saw Iris-san standing there with a towel in her hand.
“Yes, here’s the towel.”
“Ah… sorry, thank you.”
“And here’s your water. So, are you hurt or something? Are you okay?”
“Eh? I-I’m fine!”
“Are you sure? You’re not lying, are you? If there’s anything that’s bothering you, don’t hesitate to tell your Onee-san, okay?”
Iris-san was taking such good care of me that I’m afraid I’m going to shrink, but since Master Usagi has never cared for me like this before in my training, I’m somewhat confused. However, I was grateful that she was concerned about me, so I thanked her honestly.
“T-thank you very much. Thank you so much for doing this for me…”
“It’s okay. …I want to be with you as much as possible like this.”
“Eh?”
“It’s nothing.”
“H-huh…”
As you may have guessed from Iris-san’s presence here, after Quarro’s attack, not only did the intensity of my training with Master Usagi increase, but Iris-san also began training me.
As a result, I was able to use the Sword Saint techniques, like the [Single Sword Flash] that I just unleashed on Master Usagi.
…The control was still not as good as it should be, and it was not as powerful nor fast as Iris-san’s, so I need to continue training well…
However, just like the Spear Saint technique, the Sword Saint techniques were not reflected in my status for some reason.
When I let out a sigh again, Iris-san looked around.
“Even so… I never thought that Yuuya-kun is living in the Great Devil’s Nest… and this house seems to be protected by magic that even I don’t understand… No wonder that Usagi is learning magic from Yuuya-kun. I wonder if I should learn it too?”
Yes, Iris-san had come to my house in the Great Devil’s Nest, just like Master Usagi, to train me.
“That’s just… I’m not that good enough to teach you…”
“You say this is not good enough…? No matter how I look at it, I think you’re a better magician than the Magic Saint…”
(I agree with you. The self-enhancement provided by the [Magic Attire] is also powerful. You’re still a little lacking when it comes to combat techniques, Yuuya, but when it comes to magic, there’s a lot to learn from you.)
Both Master Usagi and Iris-san gave me such praise, but this was all just something that I inherited from Sage-san, or rather, something that was simply given to me. It’s not that I’m amazing, but it’s Sage-san that was too amazing.
…The only thing I can do was to become a person worthy of the power I inherited from Sage-san, even if only a little. I have to work hard.
As I was thinking about this, Yuti came over from the house.
“Suggestion. Yuuya, it’s time for dinner.”
“Oh, it’s already that time, huh…?”
“Affirmative. Both Ouma-san and I are looking forward to it.”
“Yes, yes.”
I couldn’t help but let out a wry smile at Yuti’s honest words. Well, Ouma-san could not go out of the house on Earth, so I understood that the only thing he could enjoy was eating.
The training with Master Usagi and Iris-san was so intense that I lost track of time, but it was already time to eat. Then Iris-san stared at Yuti and muttered in some dissatisfaction.
“…I still don’t agree with it.”
“Eh?”
“Why are you living with a woman other than me…?”
“…..What?”
Iris-san shouted as if she was crying tears of blood.
“You’re living under the same roof with a beautiful young girl…! I don’t see how I can win! I mean, no matter what, i-it’s just so shameful!”
“Hmm? Problem. I have nowhere else to go. Yuuya invited me to live with him. That’s why I’m here.”
“H-h-he invited you…?”
Iris-san shouted, her face growing redder and redder. W-well, if I left Yuti alone, she would have continued to live in the wild forever…
“I-I wonder if young people these days are too liberal…? Or am I just too far behind?”
“Um, Iris-san?”
Iris-san was cool and sharp when she was training, but sometimes she said strange things and acted weird. It could be said that this was the reason behind the familiarity.
“More importantly! I heard that you’re the disciple of… Bow Saint?”
“Affirmative. I’m Yuti, the disciple of the Bow Saint.”
“Yes, Yuti-chan. I want to ask you one question, why are you asking Yuuya to prepare the food for you? If you’re the Bow Saint’s apprentice, I’m sure she’s taught you well, including household chores, but…”
“Hmm? Negative. The only thing I learned from my master was the Bow Saint techniques. My master did everything else.”
“Eh? Ah, no… her caring nature may have backfired… rather than being overprotective, I think it is beyond that…”
Iris-san was taken aback by Yuti’s words. No, I was surprised too. She said she couldn’t even take off her clothes by herself. It’s not a problem now, though. Kaori taught her a lot of things about that, so she was really helpful.
Then Iris-san, who had been looking dumbfounded, seemed to notice something, and her face brightened.
“Sigh! That’s right; if I show off my household skills here, I’ll have a chance…!? Yuuya-kun!”
“Y-yes.”
“Onee-san will be the one cooking for you today.”
“Eh?”
I opened my eyes at the unexpected words.
“Since this is a great opportunity, Yuuya-kun… Um, I think I’ll cook for you today to deepen our friendship… H-how about it?”
“N-no, I mean… I appreciate the thought of deepening our friendship, but if that’s the case, I’d rather be the one to cook…”
“It’s okay! Please leave this to Onee-san! I’ve been doing bridal training for a while now, so I’m pretty good at housework… though I’ve never had anyone to show it off to.”
In the end, Iris-san muttered something quietly and gave a distant look.
“Um… Is that okay?”
“Of course. I’d rather you leave it to me.”
“I-if you say so, then… please.”
“Expectations. Let’s see what the Sword Saint can do.”
“Why is Yuti looking so high and mighty about this…?”
Yuti, you couldn’t do housework… I wanted to say that again, but I held back.
Then, Master Usagi, who was watching our exchange, turned his back on us.
(Hmph. The training for today is over. Do what you want with the rest.)
“Ah, Master Usagi, aren’t you going to eat with us?”
(It’s okay. It’s more troublesome to get caught up in the fight between those two women.)
“Eh, a fight?”
When I turned my gaze to Iris-san and Yuti, I couldn’t help but notice that although they were quietly looking at each other, there seemed to be sparks flying between their gazes. W-what is it?
(Well, you’ll just have to do your best.)
After saying that much, Master Usagi walked out of the barrier of Sage-san’s house, jumped up into the air from there, and flew away somewhere using the air as a foothold.
“Eeeh…?”
As I looked over at Master Usagi, who had left after saying something disturbingly, Iris-san also turned her gaze in the same direction.
“Usagi is the same as ever… Now then, I’d like to cook quickly, may I borrow your kitchen?”
“Ah, c-come this way, please!”
In this manner, I entered Sage-san’s house together with Iris-san and Yuti.

Hi my dear readers, I’m sorry for any bad words since I’m not good at composing words. I’m also apologize for the late release. As you may know from the announcement on my Discord channel, my brother’s newborn baby was diagnosed with liver disorders. The cost of the surgery isn’t small. So, I want to help to ease my brother’s cost burden for the surgery.
And so, I made a goal for it on my Ko-Fi’s page; I’d really appreciate every penny you donate for it.
I hope it won’t annoy anyone, and that’s all for it.
Thank you very much, and here’s my Ko-Fi’s page: https://ko-fi.com/nyxtranslation
NB: I didn’t include different world cheat as it’s the latest volume published for now.
  Here’s the chapter, enjoy~
ED: Blast
Part 2
  It’s not often that I invite someone to Sage-san’s house, so it was somewhat refreshing to see Iris-san in Sage-san’s house. Until recently, Lexia-san used to come over for whatever reason, but lately, her visits had been decreasing. Well, it’s strange for a princess to visit such a dangerous place so often, isn’t it?
But Master Usagi, who I trained with every day, had actually never entered Sage-san’s house. He’s always just training with me in the garden.
By the way, once there was a time when Lexia-san tried to cook in Sage-san’s kitchen… No, that can’t be considered cooking…? The only thing I remembered was that it was very dangerous…
I was shuddering as I remembered that moment, and Iris-san was looking around the kitchen.
“Ara… it’s so well maintained. As Yuti-chan said, you are usually the one who does the cooking, aren’t you?”
“Yes, well…”
“Woof?”
“Fugo?”
“Hey, it’s time to eat. Hurry up.”
As I explained the cooking utensils’ places to Iris-san, Night, Akatsuki, and Ouma-san also came to the kitchen.
When Iris-san saw Night and the others, she widened her eyes.
“C-come to think of it… I’ve been wondering about this since we met at the Regal Kingdom…”
“Oh, I haven’t introduced them to you, by the way. This is my family, Night, Akatsuki, and Ouma-san.”
“Woof.”
“Fugo.”
“Hmph.”
Night sat up neatly and let out a single bark, while Akatsuki responded at his own pace as his usual self, raising his right paw in a carefree manner. And Ouma-san, needless to say, showed no interest in Iris-san and laid down comfortably on the floor.
As I smiled at the three of them, Iris-san froze.
“Hmm, what’s wrong, Iris-san?”
“B-Black Fenrir…?”
“Ah, Night, is it? Apparently, he’s from such a race. I heard they’re rare and very strong…”
“A Black Fenrir is not something that can be described in such simple terms as rare and very strong, you know!”
“Eh?”
“Affirmative. Yuuya, your perception is a little odd.”
“T-that’s…”
I’ve been told the same thing by Yuti, but did I say something so strange? Ouma-san said that if it’s only about strength, it’s a race that is comparable to himself, but I don’t really feel that way about it either.
More importantly, when I see Night in his daily life, he doesn’t seem to be as unpredictable as Ouma-san, and he’s very smart, so I don’t really understand such a statement.
Well, whatever it is, Night is Night, right?
When I stroked Night with this in mind, he narrowed his eyes and rubbed his body against my hand. Mmm, as I thought, he’s cute.
Then, perhaps envying Night, Akatsuki slipped under my other free hand and pressed his head against it.
“Buhi. Fugo~.”
“Yes, yes, I’ll stroke you too.”
“…By the way, what’s that red pig?”
“Akatsuki? I heard that Akatsuki’s race is called… [Mouju], but I don’t know much about them. Master Usagi said that they are one of this planet’s self-purification mechanisms, and they play a similar role to those of the Holy such as Iris-san and Master Usagi…”
“…..Then, what about the little dragon?”
“Ouma-san is an existence from the legend called the [Genesis Dragon]. I don’t know much about the details, but I heard that he is incredibly strong…”
Well, I’ve never seen him fight. Considering how intimidating he was when I first met him, there was no way he was weak. In fact, it’s hard to believe that an existence that has been alive since the time this planet was created would be considered weak.
More than that, when I introduced Night and the others again like this, it made me realize that I still don’t know much about these three at all. However, they are still an important part of my family.
When I finished introducing everyone, I looked at Iris-san again, and she had a dumbfounded expression on her face.
“U-um… Iris-san?”
“…Sigh! I am really surprised at how crazy it is… wait, no, no, no! It’s just strange!”
“Eh?”
“How can you be so calm? It’s Black Fenrir, you know? It’s a race that all of us Holy, and even our enemy, the Evil, would be no match for even if we all joined together. In addition, there is also a holy beast that is born with a special power to fight against Evil. And to top it all off, the Genesis Dragon, you say… it’s really unbelievable…!”
“Affirmative. Your reaction is just right.”
In response to Iris-san’s exclamation, Yuti nodded quietly. W-well, Ouma-san is surely an extraordinary existence, but are Night and Akatsuki really that much of a cause for concern? They’re just cute and dependable family members of mine.
Then Ouma-san, who seemed to have been listening to Iris-san’s words, opened one eye from his prone position and turned his sharp gaze on Iris-san.
“Ho? Little girl. You don’t believe that I’m the Genesis Dragon, do you?”
“Huh?”
It does not affect me, but I could tell that Ouma-san was intimidating Iris-san because her complexion instantly turned white, and she began to sweat profusely.
Seeing this, I hurriedly warned Ouma-san.
“Hey, Ouma-san! Don’t be so quick to threaten people like that!”
“W-what is it? Yuuya, you say that, but…”
“It would be nice if someone can just accept that Ouma-san is the Genesis Dragon. But, it is a problem if you had to react every time like this happened.”
“M-mm… You’re right, but…”
“And today’s meal will be made by Iris-san. If Ouma-san intimidates her, she won’t be able to cook.”
“What? I-it would be bad! I’m hungry already! The food must be prepared as soon as possible!”
Ouma-san seemed to have stopped intimidating Iris-san when he replied in a panic to my words, and Iris-san was gasping for air over and over again.
“Hah! Hah! Hah!”
“Iris-san! Are you okay?”
“Hah… Hah… Y-yeah… T-thank you…”
“No problem! I’m sorry, too…”
“It’s okay. I also made a rude remark… Ouma-sama… right? Please forgive my rudeness.”
Iris-san said and bowed to Ouma-san. Then, Ouma-san snorted.
“Hmph. Just remember that. And there is no need to address me as such. It’s annoying.”
“…Yes. I understand. Thank you very much.”
“The one who can speak strongly against Ouma-san is only Yuuya.”
“Looks like it…”
“Eeeh?”
I don’t think that’s the case… but I do believe that Ouma-san would understand if I explained it properly.
When I thought about that, Iris-san turned her gaze to me once again.
“…As expected, your family’s fighting force is crazy. It feels strange for us to be worrying about Evil…”
“W-well, isn’t that okay? However, Ouma-san said that he wouldn’t participate in the battle against Evil…”
“…Is that so? When it comes to the Genesis Dragon, he probably won’t be interested in our fight… But will the Black Fenrir Night be participating?”
“Yes. Night will fight with us. He’s still a kid, though, so he’s still growing up, just like me.”
“No, even though he’s still growing up, it’s very reassuring to have the legendary Black Fenrir as a companion. Night-chan, please take care of me, okay?”
“Woof!”
Iris-san bends down and gently pets Night. In response to Iris-san, Night barked cheerfully. It’s as if he was saying, “Leave it to me!”
“Buhi, buhi, buhi~!”
“Oh, you’re going to help too, right, Akatsuki-chan?”
“Buhi…”
When Akatsuki, annoyed by the fact that Iris-san petted only Night, squealed as if to assert himself, Iris-san stroked Akatsuki as well. Then Iris-san, who had petted both of them for a while, stood up and said with a cheerful expression.
“Now, let’s make some food to eat. Can I use the ingredients from this house?”
“Yes, please.”
I’ve got many ingredients, from the outrageous vegetables from Sage-san’s garden to the monster materials I’ve acquired from training with Master Usagi and from my personal explorations of the Great Devil’s Nest.
When Iris-san got the ingredients, she started cooking, and I decided to watch Iris-san cook for a while.
…No, it’s not that I don’t trust her, but there are precedents, like Lexia-san. A knife flew into the air at that time, after all…
When I thought about that, Iris-san picked up one of the ingredients I had prepared, the [Godspeed Potato], and threw it lightly into the air.
And then──.
Kiiiiiiin.
“Whoa!”
    The potatoes that were thrown into the air were instantly chopped up and fell slowly onto the cutting board. No way, did she use the Sword Saint technique for cooking? Is that okay? That technique is a power to defeat Evil, right?
“───[Thousand Swords]!”
“Not shredded!”
After that, Iris-san took out a cabbage, which, similarly to the potato, she threw into the air and sliced it into strips in an instant. I don’t know if it’s a good idea to use the Holy technique for mere slicing!
“[Spiral Rotation Slash]! [Unparalleled War Dance]! [Twilight Slash]!”
Peeling, chopping, and slicing thinly… such casual knife work were all done with the Sword Saint techniques. And at the same time, with the effect of my [Evil Den’s Eye], I also mastered each of those techniques.
However, I couldn’t exactly be happy about it. After all, it was not something that I acquired through training; it was something acquired just by watching a part of the cooking process…!
As I rolled my eyes at the unexpected cooking method, Kuro, who was inside me, woke up with a yawn.
“Fuwahhhh. Did you finish your training? …Ah? Why is the Sword Saint cooking in this house?”
“N-no, um… after the training was over, Yuti told me it was time to eat. Then, in order to deepen the friendship, Iris-san decided to cook for us…”
“Heh? That Sword Saint is going to cook for you…”
Kuro seemed to be somewhat impressed, and he turned his attention to Iris-san’s cooking as well as mine.
“…Hey, Yuuya. Did my eyes go crazy? That Sword Saint is using Holy technique for cooking?”
“…It’s not a mistake; she’s really using it.”
“The technique of the strongest of the Holy, the Sword Saint, is used for cooking… and from the perspective of the Evil, this is a complicated feeling…”
I guess so…
Kuro was now a part of my life, but originally he was a part of the Evil’s power. The fact that the techniques of the Sword Saint were used in cooking must be an indescribable feeling.
While Kuro and I were talking about this, Iris-san’s cooking proceeded, throwing ingredients one after another and chopping them up in an instant. But she wasn’t just cutting them up randomly. Each of the ingredients was cut to a specific size.
“This is the way it is prepared… and all the ingredients have a certain extraordinary vibe, and the seasonings are only of the highest quality. How can this be…?”
Iris-san was astonished when she saw the seasonings in the kitchen. W-well, as for the seasonings, they’re all from Earth. I’ve moved them to glass jars from this world so that people won’t know they’re from Earth though.
After the ingredients were prepared, she started cooking using the frying pan in the kitchen, and the food was finally ready.
Iris-san’s cooking skills were nothing to worry about. Although I was surprised that she used the Sword Saint technique at first, I could tell that she was used to cooking regularly.
“I-it’s done.”
“Hmm. Let’s see how good it is.”
“Affirmative. Let’s see what she can do.”
I couldn’t understand why Ouma-san and Yuti were acting so high…
While amazed at their behavior, I helped Iris-san carry the food to the table.
“Let me help you.”
“T-thank you ─ eh, t-t-this feels just like a newlywed couple…!”
“Eh?”
“I-it’s nothing! Come on, let’s eat quickly!”
While tilting my head against the suddenly excited Iris-san, each of us took a seat.
“Well then… Itadakimasu…”
I immediately took a bite of Iris-san’s food and was surprised by its taste.
“Hmm! It’s so delicious!”
“R-really? It’s the first time I’ve served it to someone… but I’m glad it turned out well.”
It seemed that we were the first ones to try Iris-san’s home cooking.
As Iris-san’s cheeks reddened slightly at my words, Ouma-san, who had looked up to me just now, gobbled up the food.
“Ouma-san also seems to find Iris-san’s cooking suitable for his taste.”
“Ugh… W-w-well, it’s not bad!”
Why couldn’t he just honestly say it’s delicious there…? No matter how I looked at it, it looked as if he enjoyed Iris-san’s cooking. Then Yuti, who was also acting high and mighty, distorted her face in frustration and took a bite of the food.
“Defeat. The Sword Saint’s food is delicious…”
“No, what were you competing in…?”
I couldn’t help but smile bitterly at Ouma-san and Yuti’s words and actions. By the way, Night and Akatsuki did not particularly complain from the beginning, and they ate Iris-san’s food with relish. These two were so cute and honest.
Iris-san, who was looking at us with some happiness, suddenly opened her mouth.
“That’s right. As one of your masters, I’m going to continue to teach you many things… And whenever you train with me, I’ll cook for you.”
“Eh?”
“If you want, I can do your cleaning and laundry too.”
“No, no, no! I can’t ask you to do that! I’m your apprentice, after all…”
“That’s why. If I do the housework for you, you can use that time to train yourself, right?”
“N-no, that may be true, but…!”
“It’s okay. You can leave it to Onee-san! Yuuya-kun should train without worry!”
What should I do? Iris-san is spoiling me so much…!
I’ve been training with Iris-san for a while now, and I’ve found that she’s been more lenient with me than I expected. Of course, the training was tough, but she didn’t push me as hard as Master Usagi; she suggested many breaks and tried to take care of me.
That’s very helpful, but if she spoils me too much, I’ll become a good-for-nothing…
When I was confused by Iris-san’s words, she was somewhat taken aback by the euphoria.
“Oh… my efforts are paying off…! If it keeps going like this… we’re going to get married…!”
As I looked at Iris-san, who occasionally departed to some distant world, I pondered how I should persuade her.

Part 3
  “So, Yuuya-kun, I’m going to give you a massage.”
“What’s the reason for that?”
After we finished eating, Iris-san suddenly said that with a lovely smile. And then she tilted her head in wonder.
“Is there something wrong?”
“Um… how did you come up with that idea?”
“Ara, it’s quite simple. I’m your master, and taking care of my apprentice’s body is one of the most important things a master can do. That’s why I’m going to help you relax your tired body.”
“Huh? B-but, Master Usagi has never done that for me before.”
“Well, it can’t be helped. It’s Usagi, after all. But, I’m not Usagi! Therefore, please leave it to me!”
I was pushed over the edge and ended up accepting a massage from Iris-san.
However…
“Hmm? What are you doing? Take off your clothes first.”
“Take off my clothes? Why?”
“Of course, because I’m going to use this.”
What Iris-san showed me was a thick orange liquid in a clear bottle.
“W-what’s that?”
“It’s an oil that I have formulated myself. It can be used to heal your muscles effectively. By infusing my Holy power into it, your body will be healed even more effectively. So come on, take it off!”
“U-ugh… Y-yes…”
Fortunately, I had a swimsuit thanks to my trip to the beach with Kaori and the others some time ago, so I changed into that swimsuit. And Iris-san, who had finished her preparations, looked back at me.
“Now, we are… rea… dy…”
“Huh? I-Iris-san?”
For some reason, Iris-san froze at the sight of me. Then, gradually, her face turned red, and she turned away from me with great force.
“W-wait! After thinking about it, it’s the first time that I will touch… a naked man! W-w-w-what should I do?”
“I-Iris-san?”
“Huh? I-I’m sorry. W-well then… can you lie down there?”
I was asked to lie face down on the bed. Then, oil dripped on my back. Ugh… it’s a little cold…
I was surprised at the oil’s coldness for a moment, but then Iris-san’s hand joined in.
“Ugh!”
At first, it was very ticklish and embarrassing because of the feeling of the thick oil and the fact that someone was touching my body, but… Iris-san’s massage was very pleasant. What can I say…? Iris-san was right; I could feel that she was rubbing and healing my muscles that I had overworked during my training.
Of course, there were no wounds on my body. Still, as Iris-san massaged me with the power of the Holy, I felt the fatigue that had built up in my body disappear, and I was healed from the core of my body.
This was… going to be addictive… But rather than that, I was starting to feel sleepy…
A message suddenly appeared in front of my eyes as I began to doze off over the pleasant feeling.
You have acquired the skill [Holy Soul].
Eeehh…? Ho-Holy Soul?
Why did I suddenly acquire this skill, and what are its effects?
Although I would usually check right away, I was too sleepy to do so right now. At first, I tried to fight the drowsiness, but in the end, I succumbed and fell asleep without checking the new skill I had acquired.
  ＊＊＊
  “…..”
When the massage caused Yuuya to fall asleep, Iris’s mind was in serious trouble.
(Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! I-I’m now… touching the skin of a man!)
While desperately trying to calm her inner turmoil, Iris continued her massage. The only person who had ever given this massage to Iris was her master, the previous generation of Sword Saint.
This was the first time she had given a massage to a man, and she was confused. She had never been in any relationship with the opposite sex before. The only man she was close to was her father, so she had never had the opportunity to get this close to a man, much less touch their skin.
But Iris wasn’t the only one getting flustered.
“Aaaarrggh! S-Stop it…! H-hey, Yuuya! Wake up! Wake up and stop this woman!”
While Iris continued her massage, Kuro, who was inside Yuuya, was screaming. This was because the massage that Iris was giving used the Holy’s power, and by pouring it into Yuuya’s body, combined with the effects of the oil, it was healing Yuuya’s body.
That’s why this massage was nothing but torture for the Evil Kuro, who was originally an enemy of the Holy.
“Hey, Sword Saint! Stop that hand right now! If it continues… I will be gone!”
(W-whoa… A-as expected… M-men are very strong…)
“N-no, my eyes are completely turned off…!”
Kuro’s cry did not reach Iris. Instead, Kuro’s voice can only reach Yuuya, so it could be said that it was a futile resistance.
(More than that, Yuuya-kun, he’s sleeping… right? It’s really a beautiful face when I look at him like this…).
Iris, who was able to look at Yuuya’s face more closely than usual, was naturally drawn to his face.
(When I think about it, this boy saved me from Quarro’s attack… I never thought of having a man save me before…)
Iris blushed again as she remembered how Yuuya had held her and saved her when Quarro attacked.
Even though Iris didn’t seem to be concentrating on the massage, her hands were precisely taking care of Yuuya’s body without the slightest hesitation.
“Damn it! This woman doesn’t look like she’s concentrating at all, but she’s pouring the power of the Holy into Yuuya’s body…! She shouldn’t use her skill as Sword Saint here!”
Kuro’s cry was plausible. If Usagi had seen this scene or had witnessed Iris’s cooking, he would have been just as appalled as Kuro.
Iris used her power as the Sword Saint for her daily life.
However, as a result, Iris was able to effectively use her power as the Sword Saint in any situation, which was probably why she was called the strongest among the Holy.
In the meantime, Yuuya’s lips suddenly entered Iris’s field of vision.
“…Hey! Sword Saint? What the hell are you thinking? Your eyes are getting scarier…!”
(…Huh? Y-you can’t do that, Iris! Yuuya-kun is much younger than you! To do that to such a boy… moreover, he is unconscious…!)
Iris contemplated this, but her gaze remained fixed on Yuuya’s lips. And she naturally swallowed her saliva.
“T-this woman, could it be…! She wants to kiss Yuuya?”
(…J-just a little… I think it’s okay if only a little…)
Kuro finally came to understand what Iris was trying to do to Yuuya. Aside from the panicked Kuro, Iris gradually brought her face closer to Yuuya while her face turned red.
“H-hey! Yuuya! Wake up quickly! If not… you will be kissed by this woman!”
Kuro repeatedly called out to Yuuya, but Yuuya still would not wake up.
And then──.
“Hmm…?”
“〜〜〜〜?”
Just before Iris’s lips touched Yuuya’s lips, Yuuya finally woke up.
Iris, who instantly sensed his presence, fully displayed her physical abilities as the Sword Saint and distanced herself from Yuuya’s face with unstoppable speed.
Yuuya, who had no idea what was happening, rubbed his eyes sleepily.
“Ah… I-I’m sorry… I must have fallen asleep because it felt so good…”
Iris then shook her head with all her might to Yuuya, who said that with an apologetic expression.
“I-it’s okay! I-it’s not a problem! You must be tired from the training! It can’t be helped!”
“T-thank you very much. …Um, what’s wrong?”
“Huh?”
Iris made a strange voice in response to Yuuya’s question. But Iris did her best to maintain her composure as she answered Yuuya.
“I-it’s nothing! Yes, nothing!”
“I-is that so? That’s fine then…”
For Yuuya, who twisted his head with a somewhat strange expression, Kuro was relieved that the power of the Holy was no longer pouring into Yuuya’s body, but he also cursed.
“Nothing, my ass! She afflicted me with a lot of pain, and then she tried to give Yuuya a strange kind of trouble.”
“Eh? Strange kind of trouble?”
“Giku!”
While confused as to why Kuro seemed to be in a bad mood, Yuuya recited Kuro’s words. Then, Iris froze when she heard it.
“W-w-w-what are you talking about? I just wanted to make sure that Yuuya-kun’s body was in good shape. There’s nothing else… yes, nothing…!”
Yuuya felt a little uncomfortable with Iris’s behavior but realized that the treatment was over and stretched out.
“Hmm…! Aaahh! That was amazing! My body feels so much lighter now!”
“R-really? That’s good to hear.”
“Yes! Thank you so much!”
“Ugh…!”
In front of Yuuya’s innocent smile and his ignorance of this whole event, Iris turned her face away. However, Iris did not intend to end here.
“T-then, for the future training…”
“Yes.”
“Whenever you finish your training, I will give you a massage, so keep that in mind, okay?”
“Geehh?”
“Eh? T-this is not the only time?”
Yuuya raised his voice in surprise at Iris’s words, and Kuro raised his voice of disgust from the bottom of his heart. However, Kuro’s voice could not reach Iris, of course, so Iris continued without any sign of concern.
“It’s natural, isn’t it? If you don’t take care of your body every time you finish your training, it’s meaningless. It’s not that you dislike it, is it?”
“That’s, well…”
“Hey, Yuuya! I don’t like it! I almost died while you were sleeping.”
“Eeh? Why?”
“Of course it’s because she poured the power of the Holy into me! I’m the Evil! The Holy’s power is a deadly poison to me!”
“Oh, that’s right…”
“What do you mean by that?”
Kuro was speechless when Yuuya’s answer was too simple.
“But it’s also true that my body felt great…”
“Guh… it’s certainly true that the massage itself is painful, but… my body is also more comfortable now than before.”
“Is that so?”
Yuuya did not understand, but it was no exaggeration to say that Kuro lived in Yuuya. The condition of Yuuya’s body was directly related to Kuro’s comfort. Therefore, the healthier Yuuya was, the more comfortable the environment would be for Kuro.
Knowing this, Kuro couldn’t argue strongly with Yuuya’s words. Thinking that by enduring the pain for a short time, he would be able to be more comfortable in Yuuya’s body, Kuro did not say anything more.
Iris tilted her head at Yuuya, who was lost in conversation with Kuro.
“What’s wrong?”
“I-it’s nothing!”
“Really? Well, anyway! I’m going to keep massaging you, so please keep that in mind, okay?”
“Y-yes. Well then… please take care of me.”
Iris made an agreement with Yuuya for massages and inwardly posed a gut pose.
She had the opportunity to touch Yuuya’s body legally… This was the result of Iris’s persistence, as she had been unlucky with the opposite sex until this age and had missed out on marriage.
──Thus, the strict and lenient training life of Yuuya continues.

Chapter 2 – Summer Festival
Part 1
  ──In a certain high-class restaurant.
It’s a well-known restaurant that celebrities, presidents of various companies, and politicians visit, and it’s not a place that ordinary people can often get into. In such a place, Miu was eating somewhat uncomfortably.
“──Miu. You know what we’re going to talk about today, don’t you?”
“…Yes.”
A middle-aged man with a well-developed face that resembled Miu’s in some way, was eating across from the model with a stern expression on his face. The man in front of her was Miu’s father and the reason for Miu’s tension.
“Then, it will be quick. A marriage proposal has been arranged for you. The other party is a young man who runs several entertainment facilities overseas, including a large casino. Recently, he’s been trying to start a new business with the money he’s gained from running the casinos. After hearing his story in detail, I feel that he has a very promising future. He will be a good fit for our family.”
“…..”
It might be suitable for you, but it’s not for our family. Although Miu felt this way about her father’s words, she did not say it out loud.
Miu’s father was the president of one of Japan’s largest companies, and Miu was actually the president’s daughter. However, instead of following her father’s ideas and joining his company, Miu jumped into the entertainment industry and became a very famous model.
Therefore…
“…I’m sorry. I’m still working as a model──.”
“Don’t tell me you’re turning this down for some silly show business?”
“Ugh!”
Being pierced by her father’s sharp gaze, Miu tensed up. In fact, she wanted to make him apologize for calling her modeling job a waste of time right now. However, she couldn’t control her body’s response, which was a subconscious reflex ingrained in her for years, and she could only remain silent.
Miu’s father spoke to her as if he was talking to a poorly taught daughter.
“Miu. I approved your entertainment activities because I believe it will lead to an enhancement of our company’s image. But apart from that, you have also promised to help our company grow if there is an opportunity to do so.”
“That’s!”
“Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten that?”
Miu, who was once again being looked at sharply, held her tongue again.
“Well, this is for your own good, too. I don’t know about modeling or whatever, but your future is secure if you work for me instead of being in the unstable and unpredictable world of entertainment. Why can’t you understand that?”
“…You don’t know how I feel about being a model.”
“I don’t know. And I’m not even interested in that.”
“Huh!?”
“No matter what you say, I intend to proceed with this marriage proposal.”
“…..”
Miu turned her face down in frustration at her father’s words. Her father let out a sigh of exasperation at the sight of her.
“Good grief… what’s wrong with you… if you marry someone I introduce you to; your future will be secure…”
“…I’m not looking for that…”
“──Miu. Don’t disappoint me too much.”
“Uh!”
Miu’s body tensed up at the sound of her father’s cold voice.
“You lack awareness as a member of the Midou family. For the sake of the development of the Midou family and for your future, this marriage is very important.”
“…Even so, I…”
Miu said this in a faint voice as if she was squeezing it out, but then she thought of a strange idea.
“W-well then… If I can bring a man who can make father feel more at ease, then you will cancel the marriage proposal, won’t you?”
“You?”
“Y-yes!”
Miu stared at her father with a serious expression. But her father’s expression was cold as if he knew that it was impossible.
“I’ve told you many times that this marriage is for your future and will greatly affect the development of the Midou family. However, if you can bring a similar… no, an even better partner, I will have no complaints.”
“Well then…!”
“Well, I don’t think you can. I have some knowledge of your social circle. There has never been a man in your life that you have gotten to know personally, has there? I don’t expect you to be able to bring someone who can meet those requirements out of the blue at all.”
After saying that much, her father resumed his meal. It was as if he had nothing more to say, and Miu couldn’t say anything else either.
  ＊＊＊
  Just when I was getting used to training with Iris-san, I was told by Master Usagi and Iris-san that today would be a day off, as I had been doing a lot of training recently. However, since I was ready to train again today, I was puzzled by the sudden break.
What should I do…? I’ve already finished my summer vacation homework early so that I can hang out with Kaori and the others before, and since I have a break from my usual training, I might as well stop doing voluntary training as well to rest my body.
I groaned for a while, but then an idea occurred to me.
“That’s right! Now that I have a day off, let’s go for a walk on Earth after a long while!”
“Woof!”
“Fugo~!”
Night and Akatsuki squealed cheerfully at my words. Then, Ouma-san, who was lying down in the room, opened one eye.
“Are you going out?”
“Yes.”
“I see. Well, I don’t think it’s going to be a disaster, but be careful.”
“Eh?”
“I’ve felt the presence of Evil before, even here on Earth. Since the worlds are connected through that door, it’s not surprising that anything can happen.”
When I went to visit Kaori’s vacation house, I met the Evil Beast in the place where we did the test of courage, and it seemed that Ouma-san had sensed the presence of it while he was in this house. As always, he’s amazing…
“What about you, Yuti?”
“Stand by. I’ll stay home. I haven’t finished my homework yet.”
“I-is that so?”
I smiled bitterly when I saw Yuti struggling with her summer vacation homework spread out on the table. Not only did she need to study for junior high school, but she also needed to catch up on the material from elementary school in order to keep up with her classes, so she needed to study more than others. It was a lot of work, but I’m always willing to help if she encountered any problems or didn’t understand something in her studies.
We went out for a walk, leaving Yuti and Ouma-san to take care of things.
“It’s been a while since we took a walk like this.”
“Woof.”
“Fugo.”
While Night wore a collar and a leash, Akatsuki didn’t have anything on him. The reason was that Akatsuki didn’t like it. Akatsuki was often at his own pace and did not do anything dangerous, and he listened to me, so I’ve left him as is for now.
“Hmm?”
As I was walking leisurely along the walking course, I noticed a bulletin board in the town. There was an advertisement for a summer festival to be held tomorrow night.
“A summer festival…? I talked about going with everyone when we came back from Kaori’s vacation house… but what should I do?”
Unfortunately, I don’t have a smartphone, so I don’t have a way to get in touch with everyone.
…I guess I should just go ahead and buy some new appliances and stuff for the house. Wasn’t it impossible to sign up for a smartphone without parental consent? If that’s the case, I would like to avoid getting one…
Even though it was my day off, I felt depressed because I remembered something I didn’t like.
“Woof!”
“Hmm? What’s wrong?”
I noticed that Night was staring in a certain direction. When I turned my gaze in the same direction, I saw Miu-san sitting on the riverside of our walking course, staring at the river in a gloomy mood.
She looks like she’s lost in thought… Did something happen to her?
Fortunately, there weren’t many people around, and no one seemed to have noticed her, so I called out to her.
“Miu-san?”
“Eh…? Oh, Yuuya-san!”
When Miu-san recognized me, she raised her voice in surprise.
“It’s been a while, hasn’t it?”
“Yes! Ah… I’m sorry that the president of my office forced you to do that before…”
“N-no! Please don’t worry about it. I think it was a good advertisement for our school…”
Yes, the president of the agency which Miu-san belonged to had asked me to cover the ball game of the Ousei Academy the other day.
“What’s wrong? You looked like you had something on your mind…”
“Oh, haha… I’m sorry, I showed my embarrassing side.”
“Oh no! Is something wrong?”
“No, it’s nothing serious…”
Miu-san was on the verge of saying something, but she shook her head once and looked at the river again.
“…Yes, that’s right. As Yuuya-san said, I was in trouble…”
“Oh, u-um, it’s late now, but you don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to.”
“Fufufu. Certainly, it’s a little late. But it’s okay. Would you mind listening for a moment?”
“Y-yes.”
As I slowly sat down next to Miu-san, she stared at the river and began to talk in whispers.
“To tell you the truth… I think I might not be able to continue working as a model.”
“Eh?”
My eyes widened at her unexpected words. After all, Miu-san was an extremely popular model. She’s been on the cover of many magazines, and there’s not a day that went by that I don’t see her in some advertisements on the street.
If I might add, I didn’t think the president of the agency to which Miu-san belongs would let her go so easily. Was there some kind of trouble with her work?
As if to answer my question, Miu-san continued.
“Of course, it’s not that I want to do this. It’s just that my family doesn’t think I should continue working…”
“Your family…”
Miu-san’s words brought my parents’ faces to my mind again, but I quickly shook my head to dismiss the thought.
“I love my job as a model. I love modeling, and I don’t want to quit. But it’s not a world where I can continue to work while there’s friction with my family.”
I didn’t know much about the entertainment industry, so I couldn’t say for sure, but I’m sure the problems she was facing were pretty complicated. Besides, I’ve never met Miu-san’s parents, so I couldn’t say anything about them, and I shouldn’t get involved in their family affairs.
I couldn’t say a word to Miu-san, who struggled with her thoughts and itching to say something. Miu-san laughed, looking a little refreshed.
“…I’m sorry for talking about this to an unrelated Yuuya-san…”
“Oh no! I’m not…”
“No. I like my job. I just wanted someone to hear that I love my work and that it’s something I can be proud of… My father denied… me that.”
I was at a loss for words when Miu-san smiled sadly at me.
Suddenly, Miu-san stood up and stretched as hard as she could.
“Hmm! It’s been a while since I went for a walk, but I was able to meet Yuuya-san like this, and more importantly, Yuuya-san listened to me. It’s a good idea to take a walk. I’ve been a little depressed lately…”
When I saw Miu-san acting cheerfully to hide the mood she was in earlier, my mouth naturally moved.
“Miu-san.”
“Yes?”
“Do you have time tomorrow?”
“Eh? Oh, you mean tomorrow? I don’t have any work tomorrow, so I do have time…”
“I heard there’s a summer festival near here tomorrow. It might take your mind off things a bit…”
“Eh? T-t-t-t-that will be… a d-d-date.”
The second half of her words were too small to be heard, but I continued.
“Of course, as long as you’re okay with me…”
“N-no! It’s okay! There’s no problem!”
For a moment, I was pressured by Miu-san, who seemed more excited than I expected, but then I breathed a sigh of relief.
“I’m glad… then let’s meet here tomorrow at 6 pm.”
“Y-yes!”
That’s how I ended up going with Miu-san to the summer festival tomorrow.

Part 2
  “…No, Isn’t that too careless of me? I…”
The next day. I started my preparations early so that I wouldn’t be late for my appointment with Miu-san, but once again, I felt that I had been too careless in inviting her.
The festival we were going to was not as large as the one held in the city. However, it was still a big one, and I didn’t need to think about what would happen if Miu-san, a very famous person, showed up at such a place.
The biggest problem of all was that I was too mismatched to her. In fact, I’m so out of proportion that it’s almost laughable. Is everything okay? Me…
“Uwaaahh… I’m suddenly getting anxious…”
“Woof…”
As I held my head in my hands, Night barked in concern and put one foot on my leg to comfort me. Thank you, Night. But I wanted to make Miu-san feel better, even if just a little. When I thought of that, my mouth was moving naturally…
However, when I thought about it more calmly, I realized that even if I wanted to cheer her up, it would be a bit too far-fetched to believe that going to a festival with me might cheer her up. I don’t know why I didn’t realize that at the time.
“Well, it’s time to go!”
As I was thinking about this and that, the appointed time was fast approaching, and I hurriedly left the house.
Night and Akatsuki were staying at home today. Of course, Ouma-san and Yuti, who hadn’t finished her homework yet, said she would concentrate on that. Homework was important, but I think it’s okay to go out with friends.
Since it was a summer festival, most people on the street were wearing yukata, but I was dressed in a normal outfit.
As you probably expected, I didn’t own any yukata or anything like that, so it couldn’t be helped, but I had chosen to wear clothes that were as decent as possible so that I won’t embarrass Miu-san when I walk next to her…
As I approached the appointed place, the streets became more and more crowded. And I felt that the people around me were a little buzzed.
Yes, Miu-san was standing quietly at the appointed spot.
──She was dressed in a yukata. I was stunned, but Miu-san noticed my appearance and smiled.
“Ah, Yuuya-san!”
“Eh, ah, yes!”
When I replied, my body tensed up. Miu-san walked towards me with a curious expression on her face.
“Hmm? What’s wrong?”
“N-no! That… I didn’t expect to see you in a yukata…”
“Oh… u-um, is it… weird?”
“Weird? No, of course not! It looks perfect on you!”
“R-really? It’s just that… you’re a little close…”
“Eh? A-aah! I-I’m sorry!”
    Miu-san asked if her yukata was weird, so I got closer than I should have… It’s really a bit of carelessness.
“I-it’s not that I don’t like it… it’s just that I was a little embarrassed…”
“…..”
When I was working as a model, I was able to stay in close contact without much difficulty, but now that Miu-san’s cheeks were dyed red, I felt awkward. I-it’s embarrassing…!
As we were both feeling awkward, I noticed that the buzz around us was getting louder.
“H-hey, that’s…”
“Ah, yeah. That’s Miu-chan, the model… right?”
“She’s wearing a yukata, so I knew she was waiting for someone in private, not at work, but…”
“She’s got a hell of a good-looking guy there…”
“It’s not like Miu-chan being an idol matters, nor does she belong to an agency that prohibits romance, right? Then, it’s okay, isn’t it?”
“Even if I understand it in my head, I can’t keep up with my emotions… It’s just that they are so innocent… they haven’t even touched hands with each other yet, have they?”
“”Are they junior high schoolers?””
I don’t know; we’re standing out more than I expected!
“Miu-san! Let’s move from here for now!”
“A-alright!”
We quickly made our way to the festival site, feeling slightly awkward.
“Wow! It’s amazing!”
When we arrived at the festival site, Miu-san’s eyes lit up. The festival site had many food stalls along the river, and the fireworks were scheduled to start around 7 pm.
Then suddenly, Miu-san smiled a little sadly.
“…Before I started working as a model, I never had the chance to come to a festival like this. So it’s kind of strange to be able to enjoy a festival like this…”
“…This is actually the first time I’ve been to a festival, too.”
“Really? If it’s Yuuya-san, I thought you would have come with your girlfriend…”
“No, no, no, I never had a girlfriend.”
Miu-san’s words made me smile bitterly. I don’t have a girlfriend… It’s too impossible for me to have a girlfriend.
And I didn’t remember ever coming to a festival with my parents. Grandpa traveled all over the world, and now that I think about it, I’d never participated in a normal event with him like this. There’s nothing I can do about it now, but I wish I could have gone out with my grandpa more when he was still alive…
When I was a little bit sad, Miu-san turned her head down as if she was thinking about something.
“I see… Yuuya-san, you don’t have a girlfriend, huh…?”
“Eh?”
“Oh, no! It’s nothing!”
If Miu-san says so, then it must be nothing.
When we were both excited about our first festival, we noticed that the surroundings were buzzing again.
“H-hey, that’s…!”
“No way, it’s Miu-chan!”
“More importantly, that guy with her is the male model who was being talked about before… isn’t he?”
“…Are we attracting attention again?”
“R-right. Well, let’s not worry about it and just enjoy ourselves, shall we?”
“Yes!”
I’m worried about the stares around us, but we can’t do anything about it if we care too much, so we decided just to enjoy the festival.
“Wow… there are so many different food stalls!”
“Yes, there are. Oh, would you like to eat something? There’s a shaved ice shop there…”
“Let’s try it!”
I immediately lined up at the shaved ice shop I saw and ordered some.
“It’s been a long time since I’ve had shaved ice.”
“You can’t have shaved ice unless you have a chance like this.”
We took a break from the stall and ate the shaved ice we had bought.
“Did you get the blue Hawaii flavor, Yuuya-san?”
“Yes, and Miu-san has the strawberry flavor, right?”
“Yes! …Speaking of which, I heard that shaved ice syrup actually tastes the same.”
“Eh, is that true?”
“Apparently, the base flavor is the same, but just by changing the scent or color, it tastes different.”
“Eeh?”
If that’s true, then it must be an illusion of the brain(?). Human beings are mysterious.
As I stared at the shaved ice in my hands, Miu-san chuckled.
“There are two flavors, so why don’t we give them a try?”
“Eh?”
“Yes, aaahhn.”
“!?”
I felt my body tense up at Miu-san’s sudden action.
“Mi-Mi-Mi-Miu-san?”
“Here, eat quickly, or it will melt.”
“Eh, ah, yes!”
When she said it would melt, I almost reflexively dipped my mouth into the straw-like spoon that Miu-san held out to me.
Then Miu-san asked me happily.
“How is it? Do you feel the same taste?”
“…..I can’t taste it at all.”
“Eeehh?”
Miu-san’s mouth twitched in frustration at my answer.
No, I was too nervous to taste it! Is it just me? Am I worrying too much?
“Can I try it too?”
“Eh?”
Aside from my anguish, Miu-san put the shaved ice that I was scooping up directly into her mouth.
“Mi-Miu-san?”
“Hmm~…”
Then, after moving her mouth to taste it for a while, she stuck out her tongue.
“…I’m sorry, I couldn’t figure it out either.”
Miu-san’s tongue was reddish, as was her cheek.

Part 3
  After resting, we went around the festival again. Not only me, but it seemed that Miu-san was embarrassed when we were feeding the shaved ice to each other, and the atmosphere remained awkward for a while.
However, the nervousness gradually disappeared, and we were able to enjoy the games…
“Ah, target shooting!”
Miu-san found a target shooting stall and ran over to it. There were a variety of prizes on display, including candy, air guns, and dolls.
“Oh, that stuffed animal is so cute!”
Miu-san pointed to a huge stuffed cat.
A man who seemed to be the owner of the stall approached us.
“Oh, what a beautiful Nee-chan. You must be a real challenger to aim at that.”
“Is that one of the prizes?”
“Of course. Everything you see here is a prize; as long as you can knock it down, you get it. How about it? Do you want to try?”
“Yes!”
Miu-san replied happily, paid the money, and decided to play the target shooting.
But…
“H-huh?”
The stuffed animal that Miu-san wanted was a big target, and although she didn’t miss the target, it didn’t budge no matter how many bullets hit it. Well, I guess that’s natural. The bigger the target, the heavier it is, and it’s very difficult to drop it with a toy gun and cork bullets.
In the end, Miu-san used all her bullets on the stuffed animal, but the stuffed animal did not move at all.
“Oh…”
“That’s too bad. You’ll have to try again when you feel like it.”
“As expected, it’s difficult.”
Miu-san came back to me with a bitter smile.
…Today, I invited Miu-san to have fun with me.
Therefore…
“Miu-san, please wait a moment.”
“Eh?”
“Mister, please let me try it once.”
“Oh, now the boyfriend is the challenger?”
“N-no, he’s not my boyfriend…”
The tease from the target shooting’s stall owner made both Miu-san and I blush as we remembered the shaved ice event earlier, but I regained my composure, and after paying the stall owner and receiving the bullets, I headed for the table closest to the stuffed animal Miu-san wanted.
“Does this brother want to try for that stuffed animal as well? Well, I can see that you want to show off to your girlfriend───.”
I could tell that the target shooting’s stall owner was saying something, but I was focused on the stuffed animal. Then I activated my skill [Weakness Detection] on the stuffed animal.
Some parts of the stuffed animal seemed to glow. These glowing areas were probably the stuffed animal’s weak points. The only question was whether the power of the cork would be enough to drop it…
I looked at the other prizes as I focused on dropping the stuffed animal again. And then, as if the skill of [Weakness Detection] was showing me the way to get rid of the stuffed animal, shining spots appeared on other prizes.
In this case…
I set my sights on the small box of candy next to the stuffed animal.
“Huh? B-brother. The stuffed animal is over there──.”
I heard the stall owner was saying something, but I didn’t hesitate to fire the gun in that direction.
The bullets I fired flew exactly where I aimed. The small box of candy that was hit by the bullet spun and flew away at an incredible speed, hitting another prize nearby.
The other prize was a slightly larger box-shaped prize compared to the previous one. The small box almost falls off the shelf, but in the process, it hits another prize. That prize was a large air gun that was placed in a perfect balance. When the air gun fell, the impact shook the entire table on which the prize was placed, and the stuffed animal I was aiming for fell off.
“Huh?”
“A-amazing!”
“Mister… this means I got it, right?”
He was frozen in surprise, and when I asked him that, he nodded his head repeatedly. That’s good then.
After receiving the stuffed animal as a prize from the stall owner again, there were still some bullets left, but I ended the game at this point and handed the stuffed animal to Miu-san.
“Here it is.”
“Eh? B-but, it was Yuuya-san who obtained it…”
“I obtained it for you, Miu-san. So please take it.”
“Yuuya-san… Yes, thank you!”
Miu-san then received the stuffed animal and smiled. Yes, it was worth taking it just for this.
And then the target shooting’s owner who was watching us came in to make fun of us.
“Hyu! I’m so happy for you, Nee-chan! It’s a present from your boyfriend!”
“A-as I said, I’m not her boyfriend!”
If such a misunderstanding spreads, it might affect Miu-san’s work.
“Boyfriend…”
As I desperately tried to clear up the misunderstanding, I didn’t notice that Miu-san was thinking about something.
Then, by winning the large stuffed animal, I attracted the attention of the people around, and once again, people gathered around us. Sensing that I would be stuck in this situation, I immediately suggested Miu-san.
“T-that’s right! Miu-san, let’s go see the fireworks now!”
“Y-you’re right!”
After getting Miu-san’s approval, we quickly moved to a place where we could get a good view of the fireworks, away from the crowds. However, at this time of the night, everywhere was packed with people; even at our destination, there were many people.
However, the fireworks were set off in the sky, so it’s not impossible to see them.
Then──.
“Wow!”
“…It’s amazing.”
We shouted in admiration as we watched the fireworks being displayed. The colorful fireworks looked great in the night sky, and with the loud sound and vibration of the fireworks, they resonated well in our eyes and our hearts.
…I’ve never had the chance to see the fireworks like this before. Of course, I knew that there were fireworks displays and festivals, but I had never had the time to enjoy them before.
As I stared at the fireworks, I spoke to Miu-san next to me.
“Miu-san. I don’t know how much I can help you with your problems. But if you’re having a hard time, you can always invite me to have some fun like this to take your mind off things.”
“Yuuya-san…”
As I stared at the fireworks for a while, I suddenly felt a tug on the hem of my clothes. When I looked in that direction, I noticed that Miu-san was looking at me as if she had made up her mind about something.
“Miu-san? What’s wrong?”
“…Um, Yuuya-san…”
“Yes.”
“I… with me…. Will you go out with me?” (T/n: Tsukiattekuremasen ka.)
“…..Eh?”
    The sound of the fireworks launched felt like it was too far away.
  ＊＊＊
  “Geez… Yuuya, you should be more concerned about me.”
When Yuuya enjoyed the festival with Miu, Ouma, who was unable to go out on Earth, was lying down in the house, looking somewhat sulky.
At the sight of Ouma, Yuti, who was doing her homework in the same living room, looked up.
“Compromise. Ouma-san, you are an unbelievable existence on this Earth. That’s why you can’t go out there carelessly.”
“I know that, too! Yes, it’s really annoying that my body feels this… inconvenient.”
“Woof.”
“Fugo.”
Night was confused by Ouma’s unfaithfulness. Akatsuki was lying on his belly, looking uninterested.
“Eeei, it’s boring, it’s boring! I’m too bored!”
Ouma was rolling around like a spoiled child, but then he suddenly remembered something and stood up.
“…That’s right. I think there’s still a place in this house where I’m not bored!”
“Question. Where?”
“The warehouse!”
When Ouma said that, Yuti immediately understood where Ouma was referring to. The warehouse was the room where Yuuya’s grandfather kept his collection of items, including the Door to Another World.
“Agreed. But, is it okay to enter without permission?”
“Hmm. It’s up to me how I spend my time in this house. He should be grateful that I don’t walk around outside on this Earth.”
“Confused. As for that, well…”
“And I’m also a member of Yuuya’s family. So, there’s nothing wrong with spending time as I please in this house, is there?”
” …Whatever. Just make sure Yuuya doesn’t get mad at you.”
Realizing that it was useless to say anything to Ouma, Yuti resumed her homework. Ouma snorted at her.
“Hmph. Even if you don’t tell me, I’ve thought of that.”
“Woof…”
However, Night thought that it would be bad if something happened while Yuuya was away, so he turned his head to Ouma in confusion. Then Ouma let out a sigh.
“Sigh… You don’t have to worry about that. I’m not going to blow up this house or do anything crazy like that. I’m just going to spend a little time exploring that warehouse.”
“Woof!”
That’s obvious! Night barked as if to say that.
“…Fufufu. That room is so creepy that it makes even me flinch.”
The warehouse was swirling with a dense and impossible torrent of power that even Ouma, the Genesis Dragon, could barely figure out.
Ouma decided to move to the warehouse.
“I don’t know why Yuuya can’t feel anything when he sees this room. Is he a big deal, or is he just dull…”
He immediately looked around and began to rummage through the items that were placed there.
“As I thought, this place is interesting. There are many things that even I don’t know what they are… No. There aren’t the only things I don’t understand!”
As Ouma said, everything in the warehouse was unknown to him.
“This is… a coffin? Although it is in the shape of a human being… it is a very luxurious coffin.”
The first thing he touched was a golden coffin that looked as if it contained an Egyptian pharaoh.
“Mmm… It’s strange. There is no sign of it opening at all. It’s certainly locked with a magical device, but it’s built with a magic system that even I don’t know… and it would be difficult to open by force. Of course, if I were to go all out, I’d probably be able to do it, but if I did, I’d probably end up blowing up this house as well…”
Ouma quietly gave up on opening the coffin.
“It can’t be helped… So, what about this mask?”
The next thing that interested Ouma was a black mask with an eerie smile on it. Overall, it had a miserable, devilish appearance, and it seemed like one would be cursed by wearing it.
“…This mask is outrageous. It has a terrifying amount of magical power in it.”
It seemed to be cursed.
“No, wait, this is weird. Why would something like this be left out in the open?”
No matter what he thinks, the mask in front of Ouma’s eyes is not something that should be left unattended.
Because…
“…If I were to receive the curse from the magical power of this mask, even I would die if I take it lightly.”
What a surprise, it seemed that even Ouma could be cursed to death.
The warehouse was also filled with various other things, such as old coins, keys of unknown uses, and old Japanese picture scrolls.
Ouma muttered in exasperation.
“…Isn’t it easy to defeat the Evil with just the items that are here? At least, by using the magical power of that mask, it would be over in one shot. Well, first of all, it shouldn’t even be touched, so it can’t be carried around…”
In fact, some of the items in the warehouse have far more dangerous powers than the cursed mask, but Ouma and Yuuya, they do not have the option to use them without knowing the details.
“Well, I feel the similar powers from other things as well…”
As Ouma was about to say that, he turned his gaze to a certain object.
“…I can’t feel any power from this. What is it? This is…”
What Ouma was looking at was a cubic object floating on a pedestal. The cubic object has several blue-white lines running through it, giving it a somewhat mechanical appearance.
The base on which the cube was floating also had a blue glow in the center.
“What is this thing? I don’t feel any magic or spell power…”
Ouma approached the object and touched it cautiously.
“U-umu… as I thought, it’s a material I don’t know… And this pedestal is strange, too. I was thinking maybe it was the wind that was keeping it afloat, but to my surprise, I couldn’t feel anything.”
Ouma moved his hand through the space between the pedestal and the cubic object to ensure there was nothing there.
“Then… what about this?”
Ouma jumped up and clung to the cube, which was floating in the air.
“O-oh! Can it withstand my weight? Fumu… Then, how about this?”
    While clinging to the cube, Ouma poured his magic power into the cube. He wanted to see if the cubic object would react to some kind of magic. Ouma kept pouring his magic into it, but there was no response at all. As a result, the cubic object was filled with an amount of magic so strong that it could wipe out a whole galaxy.
Ouma, who had been clinging to the object for some time and pouring magic into it, eventually let out a sigh.
“Sigh… even after all this, the response is still──.”
The moment Ouma was about to say that much, the blue light that was shining in the center of the pedestal suddenly disappeared. Then, when the light faded, the cube object floating in the air fell to the floor.
“Owaa!”
Ouma was flustered by the cubic object that had fallen to the floor; it was apparent that it was Ouma’s fault.
“O-oo-oooi! Why did it suddenly fall? It didn’t seem to be a problem at all until now.”
Ouma wandered around in front of the cubic object and slapped it with his hand in a panic.
“Eeii, float! Float again! Otherwise… Yuuya will scold me!”
The Genesis Dragon was concerned about being scolded by Yuuya. Although having said that, Ouma was incapable in front of Yuuya.
He desperately took the cubic object to the pedestal and hit it with his hand. But the cubic object did not float.
However──.
“Nu!?”
Suddenly, a blue line of light running across the surface of the cube object shone strongly, and something translucent emerged from the cube object.
“W-what is it? This is…”
The thing that emerged from the cubic object was a so-called hologram, and it looked like a blueprint of some kind. Someone with specialized knowledge or the official owner of the object might have understood what it was, but Ouma had no idea what it was.
“U-umu? What is it? This unfamiliar figure is…”
Ouma tilted his head in front of the blueprint, but after a while, the blueprint disappeared.
“…Good! I didn’t see anything! That’s it!”
Ouma’s final decision was to pretend that he hadn’t seen anything at all. Ouma nodded in satisfaction, placed the cube on the pedestal, and walked back to the living room.

Chapter 3 – Perfect Evil
Part 1
  “…Do I have to go again?”
“You have to go! Yuuya-sama is the savior of the Regal Kingdom, you know!”
I was currently traveling with Lexia-san and the others in a carriage to the Regal Kingdom. The other day, when the Evil attacked the Regal Kingdom, I defeated it with the help of Master Usagi and the others, and they said they wanted to thank me for that.
Of course, this gratitude was not only in words but also in the form of a reward. However, it seemed that they had to rebuild the city that was caused by the Evil Beast right after the incident, so they delayed the invitation.
“As for me, I’m afraid I don’t deserve any thanks, but…”
“Well, I understand what Yuuya is trying to say, but you have to give up on this one. By the way, I heard that the Kicking Saint and the Sword Saint are already on their way to the Regal Kingdom.”
“So Masters were invited too…”
Master Usagi seemed to be uncomfortable with this kind of formality, but he said that he would go there… No, I don’t know if Iris-san forced him to go there or not, though.
There were many things to be concerned about, but Lexia-san and the others have prepared a carriage for me, so I can’t refuse them now. Fortunately, it was during the summer vacation that I was able to get away with it, but if it had been after school started, it would have been difficult to make time for it.
“…I have things to do over there, too…”
“Eh? Did you say something?”
“No, it’s nothing.”
I was talking about Miu-san’s case. I was just surprised at what Miu-san suddenly said to me that day, but when I listened to her carefully, I heard that she was being forced into an arranged marriage that she didn’t want and that she needed to introduce her boyfriend to her father in order to stop it.
In other words, I was asked to be her temporary boyfriend. I thought she had confessed her feelings to me, and I thought my heart was going to stop…
I wondered if it was okay for me to be there or if it was okay for me to get involved, but Miu-san asked for my help and I want to help her as much as I can.
She said that she should bring her boyfriend along, and there wouldn’t be much for me to do. But what do I wear? A jacket? A suit? Whatever it was, she asked me to prepare formal wear, so I’d have to do something about that.
I don’t know where or how to prepare formal wear… but the best thing to do would be to ask Tsukasa-san, Kaori’s father, but I don’t think I could meet the president of the school without an appointment and Tsukasa-san must be busy.
If I had his phone number, I could have contacted him, but I don’t even have a smartphone.
…I should go directly to the school and hope that I can meet someone I know. I’m relying on my luck stats at this point.
While I was thinking about this and that, we finally arrived at the Regal Kingdom.
“Exhausted. It was long.”
“Well… we’ve been sitting for a while, haven’t we?”
While Yuti, who came with me, said this with a slightly tired look, I couldn’t help but smile.
It was impossible to fall asleep in a chair like in the bullet train on Earth, so it was painful if you weren’t used to it. Yuti had probably traveled alone on foot rather than in a carriage until now.
Even so, the degree of our fatigue was still low, probably because the interior of the carriage was luxurious as it was also ridden by Lexia-san, a member of the royal family. If it weren’t for that, I would have thought of using transfer magic to sneak around.
When the townspeople saw our carriage, they waved at us with bright smiles and thanked us.
When I was surprised by this, Lexia-san stretched out her chest.
“Yuuya-sama! You should be more proud of yourself, okay? It’s thanks to you that this country has been saved!”
“N-no, I don’t really feel that way… But if everyone can be happy like this, I’m glad.”
At the urging of Lexia-san and Luna, I showed my face through the carriage window and waved my hand lightly. That action alone made the cheers louder and more frightening, but… Yuti didn’t seem bothered and rather waved proudly. It’s amazing. I envied her mentality.
Night and Akatsuki also participated in this event, but they don’t seem to be particularly interested in the scenery outside, so they stayed quiet in the carriage. As for Ouma-san… well, he hadn’t fought, and he didn’t show much interest to begin with.
When we arrived at the royal castle safely, we were led directly to the place where the king of this country ─ Orghis-sama was.
…I’m not wearing formal wear this time either, but I hope he’ll forgive me. It’s just too sudden.
I didn’t want to think that I would have many opportunities to meet with such a great person, but I also had to prepare proper formal attire for Miu-san’s situation.
As I couldn’t help but think about that, we finally arrived at a place called the audience hall.
It was similar to the place where I had an audience with Arnold-sama, the king of the Arcelia Kingdom, and Orghis-sama was sitting on a throne in the deepest part of the hall.
When I looked closely, I saw that Master Usagi and Iris-san were also there. However, I don’t know why, but their expressions were somewhat grim. I wondered if something had happened to them.
“Thank you for coming, Yuuya-dono. And thank you to all of Yuuya-dono’s companions for coming all this way.”
Orghis-sama stood up and bowed as he said this.
“Thank you very much for saving my Regal Kingdom.”
“Eeeh? P-please raise your head!”
I don’t know if I should say this, but when a great man bows to me, I feel like I will get a stomachache from the stress. I’m not that great of a person…!
It’s not that my thoughts were not understood, but Orghis-sama finally raised his head.
“Thank you very much. As gratitude for this favor, I would like to bestow upon Yuuya-dono a peerage in my country.”
“P-peerage?”
I’ve already received it in Lexia-san’s country, and it’s already too much for me…!
I couldn’t do anything about the numbers of peerage increasing further, but I knew it’d be hard to refuse when I already received a peerage in the Arcelia Kingdom.
And then Orghis-sama unexpectedly turned his gaze towards Lexia-san.
“Speaking of which, I heard that you received a peerage in the Arcelia Kingdom… but how about it? Our country is thinking of conferring a higher peerage than the Arcelia Kingdom to Yuuya-dono.”
“Eh?”
“W-wait, wait! I’m not going to let you do that.”
I was surprised by what Orghis-sama said, but Lexia-san replied with a straightforward attitude. I-is it okay? Lexia-san… the other party is a king… No, Lexia-san is also a princess, but…
When I looked at Luna, who was waiting behind Lexia-san, she had her hand on her forehead as if to suppress a headache. It’s a problem even from Luna’s perspective…
Lexia-san, who seemed to be heating up as I gave Luna a sympathetic glance, said.
“Then, I’ll give Yuuya-sama a higher peerage than what this country offers!”
“Hou? What a strange thing to say! Only the father of Princess Lexia, the king, can confer a peerage. I don’t think Princess Lexia has the right to do that.”
“That’s where my spirit comes in!”
“…It’s not good, this girl…”
I wanted to say a few words of encouragement to Luna, who looked more and more tired. She’s really struggling, isn’t she…?
But, Lexia-san. Even though I don’t know anything about politics or rules of the country, I understand that she can’t just give someone a peerage based on her spirit…
Although Lexia-san and Orghis-sama continued to glare at each other for a while, Orghis-sama suddenly relaxed his expression.
“Fuh… well, that’s okay. Let’s talk about this matter after the main topic.”
I had no choice but to nod in response to Orghis-sama’s words.
There was nothing I was looking for in particular; it was enough for me to be able to relax and have fun. I know it’s impossible.
But… I only heard about it from Lexia-san… who said that the Regal Kingdom wanted to express their gratitude once again, but it seems that there was something more. As soon as Orghis-sama had finished thanking us, Iris-sama, who had also come here, opened her mouth with a grim expression.
“Now, may I continue with the previous conversation?”
“Yes.”
Previous conversation?
It seemed that there was some sort of discussion going on before we arrived, and both Master Usagi and Iris-san seemed to have a grim expression about it. But the following words that came out of Iris-san’s mouth were something I didn’t expect.
“I’ll ask you again. Is it true that you have summoned a saint from another world?”
“Huh?”
Another world? A saint?
Then, Orghis-sama opened his mouth while receiving the gaze of Iris-san and others.
“Yes. It’s true.”
“…The problem is that you have brought people from other worlds here. Do you understand that? This is the same as abduction, you know?”
“…..”
Orghis-sama did not say anything to Iris-san’s sharp point.
“N-no way… The Regal Kingdom was doing that…”
Meanwhile, I noticed that Lexia-san was dumbfounded, and I asked her in a low voice.
“Lexia-san… are there any problems with summoning someone from another world?”
.”..There is only one problem. When summoning a person to our world, it means that the person will disappear from the original world. And that too, would be without any warning. It’s like suddenly being forcibly brought to a strange land when they were just going about their daily lives. It’s considered a form of kidnapping.”
“Yes… it might be.”
“I don’t know the details, but I’ve heard that in many cases, the person who is summoned also has special powers as a Saint. In other words, there is a high possibility that the person is in a special position in the other world. Suppose such a person suddenly disappears and is kidnapped or abducted into another world. In that case, there could even be an all-out war between this world and that world if things go badly. But… this country was in dire straits before to do such a thing.”
“…We had no choice.”
“…..”
I don’t know much about political matters, but I understood what Lexia-san was saying.
It’s true. It’s not like he or she can come and go as freely as I can, and it’s not like he or she was summoned to another world with his or her consent. The person who was summoned would be terribly confused.
When I distorted my face, Lexia-san said something that surprised me even more.
“I never thought that… the Regal Kingdom was able to recreate the magic of the Sage.”
“Eh, the Sage?”
“Yes. Yuuya-sama knows about it too, doesn’t he? After all, he was the one who defeated Ouma-sama.”
Of course, I know a lot of things.
My magic circuit was inherited from Sage-san, and the house, weapons, and items in the Great Devil’s Nest were all given to me by Sage-san.
“The magical research materials of the Sage are scattered all over the world, and in the past, there were wars fought over them, but now each country is conducting research based on the materials left behind by the Sage that are in their possession. Of course, the Arcelia Kingdom also has the materials of the Sage. And Sage’s research materials held by the Regal Kingdom are… probably related to the transfer to another world. By arranging it, it led to the summoning of the Saint this time, as His Majesty Orghis said…”
Sage-san, did you do any research regarding the other world…?
Well, that’s fine, but the biggest problem now is the person who was summoned. Even after receiving the sharp glances of Master Usagi and Iris-san, Orghis-sama remains undaunted.
“Of course, I understand the weight of my sin. And I also understand that this sin is something that I will carry with me forever.”
“…And why would you do that?”
“It’s simple. I don’t believe that the Holy alone can defeat the Evil.”
“””!?”””
We were all taken aback by the unexpected statement. As expected, Iris-san and Master Usagi did not expect this, and their eyes widened.
“Of course, it’s true that you people, the Holy, saved us. I am truly grateful. But before my eyes, I found out that several Holy people had turned to the enemy.”
“That’s…”
“I know that it takes several Holy people to deal with one Evil. Meanwhile, many of the Holy, who are our source of hope, have betrayed us. There is no longer any chance that the Holy can defeat the Evil… Don’t you think so?”
“It’s…!”
Iris-san was about to say something, but she silenced herself in frustration.
I could understand what Orghis-sama was saying. In order for humanity to survive, Evil must be defeated.
When I suddenly turned my gaze to Yuti, Yuti had a complicated expression on her face.
…Yuti’s master, the Bow Saint, was eventually killed at the hands of the humans she was protecting.
Then, Orghis-sama turned his gaze towards me.
“However, if there was one miscalculation… it was that there were other beings in this world besides the Holy that could defeat the Evil…”
Well, when it comes to this, it’s not because of me; it’s because of the items that my grandfather collected. Also, the power of the [Evil Den’s Eye] obtained by taking in Kuro, was significant.
Then Yuti opened her mouth.
“Question. The power of the Holy is indeed insufficient. But that doesn’t mean you can suddenly entrust the defeat of Evil to someone who is not even from this world, does it?”
“I’d like to reiterate that I’m grateful to the Holy for protecting humanity until now. But it’s also a fact that an existence like the Fallen Saints has appeared. I only made the best choice for this country and this world.”
For a while, gazes collided between Yuti and Orghis-sama, but Orghis-sama let out a small sigh.
“…Well, that’s fine. In order to protect this world, I summoned a new power from another world… who has the power to defeat and destroy Evil. As a responsibility, I will give that person whatever she desires. That’s the only way I can atone for my sins now.”
A period of silence ensues between Orghis-sama and Iris-san.
It’s not easy… They both have their own beliefs, and it’s hard to say who was wrong. It’s the Evil that’s bad…
I wanted to say something too, but I couldn’t come up with the words. Can a person who’s suddenly been summoned to this world be forced to participate in a battle against Evil without knowing why? That sounds pretty harsh. However, if a person was in a position to take on a country’s responsibility, such a decision may be unavoidable.
“…It’s been a long talk, hasn’t it? So, that’s it for today. I’d like to invite the Sword Saint and the others to meet the Saint that we summoned. As the protectors of the same humanity, you will be working together───.”
The moment Orghis-sama was about to say that much.
“Huh? W-what’s that?”
Suddenly, the entire castle… or even the entire country seemed to be shaking as the earth shook. As we were all startled by the suddenness of the situation, Ouma-san, who was still sleeping without any interest, opened one of his eyes.
“Hou? It came, huh?”
“Eh?”
Just as I was about to ask him what he meant, Kuro, who had been sleeping inside me, hurriedly spoke to me.
“Hey, Yuuya! Get out of here right away!”
“Wha? W-what’s it…?”
“There’s no time for explanations! Oh, shit, it’s bad…! He’s already here…!”
“───Haha.”
A creepy, cold laugh sounded. It was as if all the malice in the world was in the voice, and my body instantly froze.
